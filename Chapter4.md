# Chapter 4: Preparing an organization for strategy

If tactics are: **patterns of activities that people perform in order to achieve a strategic objective** and **tactics are patterns of behavior that when used in similar situations can achieve repeatable results.**. Then the key to successfully implementing a tactic is choosing the right pattern or patterns for the situation.

In chapter 2 we examined a framework for describing the situation an organization finds itself in. Managing that situation can improve the chances of successfully executing a strategy. This chapter will examine how the tactician can define the results their tactics need to achieve. If the tactician knows that and can create the right situation then they can select or design their tactics with confidence.

The first step towards formulating a tactical approach that can be successful is to define how the world must be different afterwards. People tend to think in terms of solutions, not in terms of problems. It’s very common for someone to explain what problem they’re having by explaining the solution they’re thinking of implementing. In almost all simple cases this is a useful trait, it helps people get to conclusions with less effort and less time. It’s a problem for the tactician when it becomes a habit. It gets over applied to more complicated problems that require more detailed analysis.

When we were building the AOL Broadband Management System our first goal was to define the infrastructure it would need. We had no hardware budget for the project but we found some servers that had originally been assigned to the London cache but never installed. So we started with some nice overspecified Sun servers available. Not long after the project started the director of the department demanded to know where we’d get a Storage Attached Network (SAN). Thoughtworks said we needed one. When I asked why they said we needed one he explained that they  needed to store some configuration files that would be shared by multiple machines. After literally a moment’s thought I said: “Just write the files to every machine”. Problem solved. Originally destined to be cache servers, all the machines had a huge amount of disk space; a few extra config files would not be a problem. Both Thoughtworks and my Director had expressed the problem to me as a solution, the need for a SAN but in fact an expensive extra piece of infrastructure that would have added a long term maintenance burden to my team was not the right solution for that problem. Expressing the problem, as a problem, the need to access configuration information from each machine, allowed us to solve the problem without buying expensive and hard to maintain hardware.

The advantage of taking a step back and ensuring you are working with the real problem is that in doing so you will be creating your case for your solution when it comes time to present it.

The Five Whys is an excellent tool to help with this. If you find yourself, either with a solution but no well defined problem, or you have a problem you’re struggling to articulate, the Five Whys will help you get to the root cause of the problem. After each question has been answered, you have an option to stop and choose to tackle the problem exposed at that level.

At M&S a few years ago I was proposing to the CTO that he should consider creating a temporary programme oversight team that could add a little strategic perspective to a transformation initiative we were working on. I suggested it could help with some of the wider reaching concerns he was expressing to his leadership team about how they were choosing which teams would get newly hired engineers. The oversight team could also help coordinate bringing new teams on to the new technology stack we were building. The CTO thought it looked like it would work but asked me why his people weren’t doing that sort of thing already. I thought of several possible reasons why they might not have thought of this but I couldn’t decide if it was due to one single root cause or a combination of factors.

After the meeting a few of us got together, the ones who worked most closely with the organizations management, and I repeated the CTO’s question to them. Like me they all had ideas but nothing quite landed. On the call we ran a quick 5 Whys exercise to try to get to a root cause:

**Question:** Why aren’t Marks and Spencer's senior leadership team thinking strategically about what's right for all of their teams in the context of the whole business?
<br>
**Answer:** They spend 40 hours a week in meetings focused on day-to-day operations. They don’t have time to think strategically.
<br>
**Question:** Why do they spend so much time in meetings all day?
<br>
**Answer:** Because they can’t make clear decisions in the meetings.
<br>
**Questions:** Why can’t they make clear decisions in the meetings?
<br>
**Answer:** They don’t have all the right people and information in the meetings, so they can’t make a decision and they need more meetings.
<br>
**Question:** Why don’t they have the right people in the meetings?
<br>
**Answer:** Because the decision making authority isn’t aligned across the hierarchy, decisions that have a financial impact, such as hiring more people or changing which department someone works in requires the most senior delivery person in the department. Those people have concerns that are above team level and aren’t usually in the meetings where team level concerns are discussed.
<br>
**Question:** Why isn’t the decision making authority aligned across the hierarchy?
<br>
**Answer:** No idea but that’s the right time to go back to the CTO and discuss what we’ve learned.

The Five Whys is a simple and powerful tool that helps you work backwards from a problem to get to a root cause. As such it's often used in post-incident reviews. It is recommended that it be used in a group, not just to spread the cognitive load but also to make sure there is enough information to answer all the questions.

## Domain Driven Design

Domain driven design (DDD) proposes that problems in software or organizations should be segregated from each other and considered in relative isolation. Once the individual problem areas are well understood the relationships between them can be modelled. If these relationships are strong enough they may cause a rethink of that segregation. This continues until there is a workable model for considering the overall domain as a series of individual problems, known as Bounded Contexts. The term comes from Domain Driven Design a 2003, book by Eric Evans.

DDD was inspired by Object Oriented Programming (OOP). This isn’t a programming book so for our purposes OOP can be thought of as thinking about the function of software alongside a model of the data the functions will process. Testing these functions requires a representation of the data, they cannot be tested in isolation. This maps well to organizational problems because at the organizational level we’re often concerned with processes and teams that transform data. A finance function that takes people, software, infrastructure, facilities costs and sales data and turns them into a balance sheet is a great example of a bounded context. They need relationships with a lot of other bounded contexts in order to get the data they need and they have sophisticated tools for processing that data. They have a few key outputs that support the organization's budgeting processes and quarterly and end of year statements needed by the board and investors to judge the health of the organization.

DDD provides a tool to examine the problems an organization is trying to solve from many different angles. DDD then provides a mechanism to consider how those different problems might be grouped together and separated from each other in a variety of different ways in an attempt to identify a useful structure optimized to solve the problems the business faces.

DDD presents the tactician with a simple way to analyze a complex set of problems in an organization in a data driven way. There is room in this analysis for intuition and opinion and even biases but it’s very easy to test whether the ideas arising from those will have a positive or negative impact. Once the bounded contexts and the relationships between them are understood it is possible to reorganize them and test the impacts of this reorganization by analyzing how the relationships change and how many problems are encapsulated by each bounded context. This way an organization structure can be optimized for the problems the business wants to solve. The weaknesses that then follow from this optimization process can also be assessed in advance of any actual changes and mitigations designed and tested.

My preferred approach is to start from a technical angle. I like to start by grouping problems, teams and functions together if software or infrastructure changes to one necessitate a change to another. This is an attempt to limit how tightly coupled the relationships are. An example of this would be grouping together Customer Relationship Management (CRM) problems alongside Customer Communications and Marketing. Changes to the CRM system and data will almost inevitably necessitate changes to communications and marketing. However CRM changes are unlikely to impact how an organization provisions and configures its hosting infrastructure. So that problem can be separated from CRM, Communications and Marketing. However it is possible that a new CRM system might need new infrastructure capabilities so there’s a relationship to be managed but there would be very little advantage to creating a team to tackle CRM, Marketing and Communications and Infrastructure so we can be content with grouping CRM, Communications and Marketing into a Bounded Context together and taking note of the relationship required with infrastructure.

In DDD we rinse and repeat this process going through all the problems an organization faces or all that it wants to tackle. Having applied the lens of grouping problems together based on where changes in one necessitate changes to another we then take another pass. The second pass might consider the skills needed to work with each problem space. That might highlight that the CRM and the Marketing systems might require completely different skill sets. This allows us to choose whether we want to change one of those systems to allow them both to be managed by the same team or whether we want to outsource one or more of those systems so they aren’t our problem to solve anymore or whether we accept that we need a polyglot team to manage both of them or we might choose to split them up and manage them with different teams. Other examples of lenses we might use to analyze these problems include but aren’t limited to:

- Alignment to a particular business function
- Whether it’s a business differentiator or an essential capability
- The data needed to support the function and the author of that data
- The customers or beneficiaries of the solutions

Every time the team takes a pass over the problem spaces it gets faster to validate or invalidate the approach.

It’s a tough exercise but if the right stakeholders are present and a little pre-work is done multiple passes over an organization can be made in a day.

The enormous advantage of using DDD to help design an organization is that the justification for the reorganization emerges from the exercise itself making it significantly easier to explain the reasons for the re-organization to the board and the individuals affected most by it.

Until 2022 Marks and Spencer’s technology organization was largely structured around projects. When a problem was prioritized and assigned a budget a software solution would be chosen and a team built around that solution. Occasionally a larger solution was implemented that might cross several team’s boundaries and that might lead to some decommissioning and some teams might merge into a larger team. Unchecked this approach will quickly devolve into chaos, Marks and Spencer is a big place with devolved budget authority and it would be very easy for departments to solve the same problem multiple times.

 In 2022 the enterprise architecture team and the most senior software engineers engaged in a Domain Driven Design exercise. The purpose of the exercise was to use their extensive retail and domain knowledge to get ahead of the problems. Rather than wait for problems to be prioritized this group would look to the next few years and identify the most important and most urgent problems and propose teams be built around solving those problems rather than being built around supporting software solutions that had been chosen to solve the problems. This, in turn, provided the opportunity to make some strategic decisions around programming languages, frameworks and infrastructure that allowed Marks and Spencer to standardize some aspects of its technology allowing it to build recruitment pipelines for building their own teams. This also allowed for the creation of platforms that could reduce the work of the teams building these new systems. All of this brings medium term efficiency and cost saving opportunities that just aren’t available when each problem is considered in isolation and then customized to fit the situation. This is only possible if DDD is combined with the inverse Conway maneuver.

## Principles, behaviors, processes, training and expectations

Having got to the root of the problem that needs to be solved the tactician now needs to understand what tools they have available to help them solve the problem. The most important consideration to understand is the people.

The military has been executing strategies longer than anyone else. It’s worth comparing and contrasting the way the military and business operate and how that impacts the execution of strategy. The military focuses a lot of time and money ensuring military personnel know what to expect of each other. This is summarized as training. Before a service person is asked to join their team and do their job they are subject to around a year of training. The training doesn’t end when they join their team. Specializations and promotions sometimes require additional training and certifications. Service personnel are taught what to expect from each other and what to expect from their managers and their leadership. They are taught how to use their equipment and given significant time to practice with that equipment in different situations. Once they are in their teams they are trained alongside other teams so they can understand what’s expected of their team by other teams. Contrast that approach with technology organizations. Some large organizations have graduate programmes but they aren’t in every company. New engineers joining a technology company are often expected to be productive immediately. Engineers, new to an organization, might have a completely different set of skills and expectations picked up from their previous companies. Companies are aware of this and so there is a tendency to choose technologies that are in common use. This is done so that  onboarding time can be minimized but setting up development environments to work on legacy systems can still be challenging.

At Just Eat engineers owned and managed the services they built from start to finish. In my Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) department we put almost all of our energy into building and improving the tools the software engineers used to build and manage their services. This included the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud infrastructure. All the infrastructure-as-code (IAC) was Cloudformation and we stored variables in a Consul store. This meant that ideally we needed to hire software engineers that knew how to work with AWS. The interviews were primarily designed to assess whether the candidate was capable with C# and .Net, the language and ecosystem they’d be using to develop their services in. Most candidates were just asked: “Do you know AWS?” almost invariably they said yes and they were hired. It was common to find that they didn’t know AWS. None of them who came to us for help had ever lied in their interview. It was just that in their last company they only used AWS through the web console, or all the infrastructure was managed by someone else and all they had to do was run a command to deploy the application. Not having worked directly with infrastructure before meant they didn’t know there was more to it. We also encountered people who had been using other tools that managed AWS on their behalf but didn’t know they were because it was never explained to them. The most common support requests we received were simply due to the software engineer not knowing how to do something with AWS in a cloud native way. This shows that when asked people can think they know something without actually knowing something, through no fault of their own. They just have a different set of expectations of what knowing something means than the questioner. We have pairing exercises that we use during the interview process to ensure we have similar expectations when it comes to programming but we can’t apply that process to every aspect of a role.

Technology organizations usually consider training to be a cost or even an employee benefit as opposed to an investment. Training is usually the first thing to get cut when economic conditions get tough. This always reminds me of the old joke:

**Manager 1:** “What if we train them and they leave?”
</br>

**Manager 2:** “what if we don’t train them and they stay!?”

Universities still aren’t preparing software engineers to enter the workforce. Many graduates have never developed software in a team, they’ve never tried to extract requirements from non-technical stakeholders. They’ve never needed to resolve an incident in the dead of night. They’ve never participated in a post-mortem or needed to deploy their code to a cloud. Universities are only giving them the most basic programming skills. This means new engineers face a daunting task when joining a new organization. Coding boot camps exist that do emphasize these aspects of life as a software engineer but these are still quite rare.

No strategy can be successful if the people involved can’t execute basic tasks. The tactician needs to lay some groundwork before they can hope to successfully execute a strategy. This groundwork might require specific strategies but more usually take the form of **Principles, behaviors, processes, training and expectation setting**.

### Principles

Principles describe a set of expectations that several teams are expected to share. In this way principals can be thought of as a contract signed by all the teams. Principles are a useful tool when choices need to be made as they can provide some guidance for choosing one solution over another. Strategies can be designed assuming the principles will be true. The strategy and the principles can be designed to reinforce each other. A team member who acts contrary to the principals (and the strategy) can be performance managed.

One of the most famous examples of principles driving and supporting strategy is Jeff Bezos’ infamous memo:

>All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service interfaces.
>
>Teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces.
>
>There will be no other form of interprocess communication allowed: no direct linking, no direct reads of another team’s data store, no shared-memory model, no back-doors whatsoever. The only communication allowed is via service interface calls over the network.
>
>It doesn’t matter what technology they use. HTTP, Corba, PubSub, custom protocols — doesn’t matter.
>
>All service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up to be externalizable. That is to say, the team must plan and design to be able to expose the interface to developers in the outside world. No exceptions.

The memo was never intended to be public, as you can probably tell by the tone, it was made public accidentally. You can read more about that story here if you’re interested: https://gist.github.com/chitchcock/1281611

While this principle was handed down rather than created by a group looking to work together to achieve the best result it did the job. It helped Amazon become the giant success it is today and led directly to the creation of the Amazon cloud.

These principles also provide a great test for software choices. Clearly following this principle Amazon wouldn’t choose to buy any solution that doesn’t offer an API.

Principals are more usually derived in an inception workshop. This style of workshop has a great way of levelling the playing field for the people in the room; CTOs can choose to collaborate on an equal footing with junior engineers and in so doing will agree a set of principles together. This is a powerful way of not only creating the principals but beginning the process of creating a mutually agreed set of appropriate behaviors.

### Behaviors

Dave Williams, CTO for Trustpilot likes to say: "You get the culture you tolerate". In order for an organization to be able to execute a strategy it must have an environment where that’s possible. That environment has many components but by far the most important is the behaviors exhibited by the people within it. Environments that contain many ways to fail and few ways to be successful, where nothing is ever praised or where nothing is ever certain creates cautious people who won’t commit to anything. It’s impossible for people, who are protecting themselves, to commit to a strategy, they often don’t even recognize a strategy for what it is, even after they’ve been told, because to them everything is a trap and success is defined as avoiding traps. The safe thing to do in these environments is not to do anything at all.

This means that prior to the formulation of a business strategy the behaviors of the people within that environment should be managed. Changing those behaviors might require specific tactics and if the goal is a significant transformation it almost certainly will. In such transformations I have a saying: “Make it easy to do the right thing and hard to do the wrong thing”. In a security and governance context that means creating processes, tools and systems that are secure by default, as opposed to needing security applied afterwards.

Changing the behaviors of people in a company requires a two pronged approach. People must be rewarded for good behavior and punished for bad. Reward and punishment, in this context, are subtle. A reward is not a celebration or an Amazon gift card. A reward in this context is a combination of praise and listening to the people in the team and ensuring they have the  resources they need to be more successful. If it’s a product delivery team, give them some support from SRE to help improve their pipeline or observability, or give them a delivery manager to help them organize themselves better. Then celebrate the team’s accomplishments in public, not the team themselves but rather what they have achieved. Again this doesn’t require an all-hands and public thanks and a gift card. This means private praise and public recognition of the capabilities of the product. Punishment is equally subtle, if a team is struggling with decision making, point out other teams who are doing it well and suggest the struggling team learn from them. If a team's product or service is lacking capabilities, have leadership lead workshops and spend time with them to help identify where the problems are. A team receiving such attention will be keenly aware that no one else is getting such attention and should figure things out.

Another common aphorism is that: Culture flows from the top. If the organization's leaders are displaying toxic behavior then the rest of the organization will inherit that behavior. If leaders are always interrogating their people and nothing is ever celebrated then the rest of the organization will do their best to stay out of the firing line and not step up and be bold.

### Processes

The power of processes is vastly underestimated in product and technology organizations. Many organizations create processes without even realizing the impact those processes have. While those processes achieve their goal, they have inadvertent knock-on effects. These effects can be so widespread that they aren’t even noticed. Processes are mentioned here because they can impede or assist a strategy.

A common pattern in technology organizations is to align themselves under lines of business. They devolve budget authority to those lines of business. This allows each line of business to be accountable for its success. This is a very powerful move that many organizations are too afraid to make. Unfortunately it's also relatively common for finance departments to demand such onerous processes that they cause the business to miss out on all the benefits of the approach. The company ends up being the kind of place where every decision requires five meetings with increasingly senior people. This renders what could have been, a transformative strategy pointless. This is a case of process hindering strategy.

This doesn’t mean creating processes should be avoided. It' just that The Law of Unintended Consequences must be considered. The first thing to do when considering creating a processes is to ensure there is a process for changing the process. Once that’s clear, processes should be designed to be as constrained as possible. Some people love a process and will work very hard to over-apply a process. This is particularly true in organizations where there hasn’t been much clarity in the past. This means it’s important to specify the situations where a process should be used and where it shouldn’t. Processes should also be published alongside a description of the intended outcomes. This empowers the people involved to inform the process owner of any unintended consequences. Processes must always have an owner. The process owner must be accountable for the results achieved by the process both positive and negative.

To the tactician, processes represent a hard point in the tactical landscape. They are units of execution that can be relied upon. This is another reason why they should be constrained because as much as being able to rely on them can be useful, they also remove options. If processes are too large changing them might well require another tactic.

### Training

Training in the technology industry has taken on a bizarre meaning.It typically means attending a three or four day course. Sitting in a sterile classroom environment, usually in a rented workspace. The training involves some classroom-style learning about generic situations with minimal context. Then, the person returns to work to go back to doing what they were doing before. Where they then forget all they learned. Very rarely is any effort made to use what was learned. The net result is that the employee is told they have been invested in. They get something to add to their CV, which hiring managers tend to ignore except in rare, specific cases.

The training that actually has an impact in Technology comes from the little rewards. From things like submitting small, easily understood changes to a complex codebase. This trains the rest of the team to work in smaller increments. When obnoxious, over-opinionated, engineers are promoted, then everyone around them is given a lesson in what success looks like. Every action taken is training for the people close to that action and those affected by it. This is another example of why behaviors are so important. Every behavior tolerated, rewarded, or punished trains everyone in the organization.

When formulating a tactical approach, it’s important to know what people are trained to do. When implementing a new tactic it might be necessary to prepare some sort of training. A few years ago I led a team to help an organization move away from a large, complex codebase that no longer had any discernible rules. We needed to encourage people to engineers to design smaller, discrete solutions that could be tested. These should be easily understood and shouldn't be magnets for additional features. This was a new technology strategy, supported by an architectural direction. I was asked to help onboard new engineers. I would talk new people through a high-level architecture diagram of the all of the different technology stacks. I would explain where it was difficult to make changes and where it was easy. I would describe where there was space for new solutions that didn’t need to reference old technologies and data sets. I would provide a view of what a good implementations looked like. Finally, I would offer a service as a reviewer for any solutions the new engineers or their teams might consider. This was usually the first time the new engineer was introduced to the wider context of the organization’s technology. As such it presented an opportunity to instil some key principles, values, behaviors. This worked really well. When these new engineers had questions or concerns they would come to me as well as their team lead. This allowed there to be several views on what good looked like.

### Expectations

The best way to give someone the space to do their job but ensure it’s done to the right standard is to set expectations. Expectation management can span the entire gamut of a job. It can help ensure a job is well defined before work begins. It can help ensure the job is completed to the right quality standards. Expectation management can also ensure that appropriate aftercare is provided and that customers and stakeholders receive the right communications.

Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) are a great tool for setting expectations. They are sometimes misused by people who think OKRs are just a fancy way of setting goals. An OKR is nothing more than defining an Objective that needs to be achieved and a Key Result that can be used as evidence that the Objective has been achieved.

A DevOps OKR might be: To improve the confidence and safety of deployments. That could be measured by an increase in the Change Rate to two deployments per engineer or pair per day.

That OKR gives an engineer a clue about the direction they should be thinking and it tells them what success looks like. On its own, that OKR could be dangerous. The engineer could, in theory, deploy solutions with known vulnerabilities. Their solution could make unreasonable hardware demands. There is an expectation that OKRs do not exist in a vacuum. For that particular OKR to be successful, there will need to be some technology standards. These standards would define languages, frameworks, and clouds that need to be supported.

Dave Williams, CIO at Trustpilot, is the master of expectation management. No one who works for Dave is ever in any doubt about what is expected of them. Even under trying circumstances, Dave doesn't resort to micromanagement. Dave always finds a way to make his expectations clear. He does this in two ways:

Dave holds himself to higher standards of behavior than he holds his people to.

Dave uses the coaching technique of helping someone understand a problem by questioning. So Dave leads people to understand what’s expected of them by having them question themselves until it’s clear to them what they need to achieve.

This ensures that his expectations are internalized by the person he's talking to. The person is not meeting the standards because they are forced to by an external authority. They are meeting those expectations because they understand, within themselves, that the standards are good. They also see their leader living those standards. With a little practice, people tend to meet Dave’s expectations unsupervised. Without thinking about it, they tend to pass these expectations on to their own people. In operating this way, Dave fulfills several of Sun Tsu’s conditions. In embodying his expectations as he does, he establishes what Sun Tsu called the Moral Law and fulfils the role of the Commander.

## Utmost Exertion of Powers

In his book, On War, General Carl von Clausewitz starts by trying to create a science of military strategy. Clauswitz attempts to break war down into its constituent parts. One of these parts he calls: Utmost exertion of powers where he says:

>“If we are to defeat the enemy, we must proportion our efforts to his powers of resistance.”

Applying that premise to technology, where our enemy is the problem we are trying to solve. We need to ensure that we have enough people with the right capabilities and tools to match the scale and complexity of the problem. If the problem is very large, it will need a large number of capable people and large budgets to tackle it. Managing large numbers of people and large budgets is inefficient and so the problems need to be broken down into smaller problems with clearly defined milestones. These smaller problems should be defined such that solving them is either trivial or brings significant business advantage. In this way confidence grows and morale is improved. Making the achievement of these milestones visible to everyone in the organization will convince the budget holders to make more money and more people available. Each problem solved builds the organization's knowledge. In this way the successful execution of each tactic can act as an inspiration for other business ideas. This reinforces the value of tactics and the tactician and might unlock more people and resources for tackling more problems. This approach will successfully lead to the successful execution of a strategy, assuming external factors don't get in the way. The end result of which will lead an organization to being able to approach a grand strategy where the organization is intrinsically capable of over-coming every problem without resorting to a disruptive transformation.

## Timescales for tactics

Defining the success criteria for each of the smaller problems is as much about timescales as it is about what needs to be achieved. Success might be considered to be achieved if the next round of funding is won. Looking at timescales that short is dangerous as it’s very easy to create a business that can’t grow to the next milestone. The timescale for a successful tactic needs to be close enough that the conditions won’t substantially change or become unmanageable but far enough away that substantial change can be achieved. There is also a human factor to be considered when choosing a timescale for tactics. Humans have limited attention spans. A tactic that is too long term will not engage people as it will seem unrealistic or just detached from people’s personal timescales. If each problem is ambitious enough then a long term strategy can inspire people and keep them motivated but significant milestones or proofs that can be celebrated along the way give people an opportunity to unwind from their efforts and then refocus and step back in to work on the next milestone and re-engage with the longer term goal. These are also the right moments for the tactician to engage with their stakeholders and ensure they are still working on the right problems and review the people and budgets available to the strategy and supporting tactics.

One of the most famous long term goals in history was the moon landing. In the 8 years between John F Kennedy’s speech and the actual moon landing there was almost one significant tactical accomplishment each year:

**1961:** President John F. Kennedy "I believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth."
<br>
**1962:** John Glenn becomes the first American to orbit the Earth.
<br>
**1964:** The first flight of the "dummy" Apollo spacecraft.
<br>
**1965:** Gus Grissom and John Young take off in the first flight of a two-man Gemini capsule.
<br>
**1966:** Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin complete the first US spacewalks.
<br>
**1967:** The first flight of a Saturn 5 rocket is successful.
<br>
**1968:** The first orbit of the moon.
<br>
**1969:** Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin land on the moon.

It’s easy to look back and write off this effort but I’d encourage all readers to imagine a single project at their company that could be successfully completed over 8 years and survive 3 CEO’s!

This albeit extreme example is a great lesson in how to break a long term strategy into tactical approaches. The people carrying out the strategy need to feel emotionally invested in the longer term goal but they need significant milestones to celebrate, blow-off steam, catch their breath once it’s complete before then leaning back in and refocusing on the next milestone and the longer term goal.

It’s also worth reflecting that many people in NASA probably only contributed to one or two of those milestones. To them, at that time, the longer term goal was important but other life events were more important. They had families that needed them to be somewhere else or they had better job offers or they burned out and needed to change careers or take a break. They still contributed to the overall goal and still deserve their share of the glory but to them it wasn’t an 8 year mission; perhaps they only contributed for 6 months. This is another reason why a long term strategy needs milestones. There needs to be a way that people can contribute to portions of the strategy that are realistic to them and their lives.

## Strategy is based on deception

At the end of the first chapter of Sun Tzu’s Art of War he writes:

>All warfare is based on deception.
>Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near.
>Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him.
>If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him.
>If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant.
>If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them.
>Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.
>These military devices, leading to victory, must not be divulged beforehand.
>Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his temple ere the battle is fought. The general who loses a battle makes but few calculations beforehand. Thus do many calculations lead to victory, and few calculations to defeat: how much more no calculation at all! It is by attention to this point that I can foresee who is likely to win or lose.

Strategy requires deception too. In some cases it’s because the tactics needed to achieve the strategy can be incongruous. In some cases deception is a necessary defense against disruption. The tactician should think about disruption in the same way that Sun Tsu thinks about his enemies.

### Initial tactics might appear to contradict the strategic goals

Many tactics require some set up, particularly strategies that rely on teams being able to perform autonomously like a microservice approach. Successfully implementing a microservice architecture requires deception. If one day a CTO announced to the organization that they’re going to adopt a microservice architecture it would be almost guaranteed to fail. Non-technology stakeholders would complain about the hundreds of hours of work that will be required just to recreate the business value that already exists in the current applications. Each development team would craft a different approach and possibly even choose different languages, frameworks and choose different technologies to implement them leading to unreliability and increased costs. Each team would choose where they wanted to start the initiative, some choosing services that offer no value, some choosing services that have multiple tight dependencies to existing systems meaning many other teams will get dragged into their problems. Every single one of these problems offers multiple avenues for disruption from inside and outside the organization, the chances of success approaching such a problem head-on is negligible.

Successfully implementing a microservice architecture requires deception. A successful microservice implementation can start with a single team. It can start with an opinionated CI/CD pipeline that’s optimized for a limited number of languages, frameworks and technologies. This rewards teams with an easier and more productive time if they stick to these languages, frameworks and technologies. It can start with a single team trail-blazing an approach and documenting their decision logs and lessons learned. It can start with the formation of a mission team looking at implementing a single solution and figuring out how to integrate it with the existing technologies. It can start with a set of enabling services added to the existing technology stack to make it easier for newer approaches and technologies to work with it. It can start with an API gateway layer presenting services in a coherent way even if the back-end is a disorganized mess of different solutions. Any one of these tactics can be the first step to a successful microservice architecture but in every case the stated result is not a microservice architecture it’s some lesser, easier to imagine goal that presents less surface area for disruption.

These examples also demonstrate the incongruous nature of tactics and strategies. Quite often the tactics needed to implement a strategy seem at odds with the strategy they are trying to bring into being. If we consider that the reasons for wanting to implement a Microservice strategy are usually to allow an organization to have many teams working on the same objective at the same time without the problems associated with many teams working on the same codebase at the same time. One might think that the right approach to implementing a Microservice strategy would be to start with many teams and a single codebase. However as discussed above that is never the right way to do it. Strategies that rely on many teams working together always rely on mature core components and infrastructure. Something that only a single well organized team can create. Microservice architectures are often considered chaotic because they offer the most benefits to an organization that has autonomous teams free to build what their specific parts of the product need. Chaos has its upsides; these teams need no command and control leadership to tell them when to scale up and down and when to focus on reliability or when to focus on features. These teams are quick and responsive if they have the right capabilities and the right signals. Getting those capabilities and signals relies on good infrastructure, observability and a culture of learning and adapting. None of those come from chaos. So in order to benefit from chaos at some point in the future there needs to be an initial investment in order.

The first step on the journey to defining an appropriate tactic is to recognize the ultimate goal that needs to be achieved and then understanding the conditions that are already present. Once the conditions are well understood the tactician needs to determine if any of those conditions presents a risk to the strategy and hence needs to be changed. If conditions need to be changed a tactical approach will be required to achieve that lesser goal before the focus can be switched to the main strategy. That doesn’t mean these things have to be done one after the other but it might mean that one is on the critical path to the other meaning one has to finish before the other can finish. This layering of objectives is useful because it helps break down a complex problem into smaller simpler problems. Smaller, simpler problems can each be solved by smaller and simpler tactics that each provide less opportunities for disruption but also provide more emergent opportunities.

Emergent opportunities is another reason why a level of deception is essential to implementing strategy. Long term goals can usually be achieved in a number of ways. We’ll go into more detail on this later when we discuss two-way doors, however for now recognize that in a large enough time scale there are numerous opportunities for disruption but there are also numerous opportunities for unforeseen successes that can themselves provide other ways to achieve the long term goal.

Going back to Zoopla again, I discussed how, at Zoopla there was a legacy tech stack that we had no confidence in. We were forced to expend engineering effort to attempt to see if it could be made safer and more predictable. I didn’t think it could be but we had to try. That presented me with two opportunities. If the attempt failed, as I predicted, I could double-down on my tactic of moving fast by building new solutions rather than attempt to refactor old ones. I would use the failure as an example of why my approach was the correct one. If the attempt was successful I would have a much easier time phasing out the legacy technology using GraphQL as the API for the data it created and managed because implementing those changes would be safer and quicker. Either way my goal of building small, modular components with modern languages and frameworks would be achieved.

## Conclusion

If there’s a problem that's difficult to define, work backwards through the problem using tools like the 5 whys and Domain Driven Design to identify a root cause.

Once the problem has been identified, consider all the conditions in the organization that affect the chances of a successful resolution. Identify if any of these conditions need to change in order to allow the successful resolution of the main problem. If any of the conditions need to change repeat the process for defining the problem. When considering how to change the conditions present in an organization remember that there are many different tools available that can help, namely: Principles, behaviors, processes, training and expectation management.

Once this is done, consider the timescales required to solve these problems to identify if a single, simple strategy is required or whether it will be necessary to run multiple strategies in series or even overlapping strategies in parallel.

With the timescales in mind consider other avenues of disruption such as powerful stakeholders or chaotic team members and how they can be brought on-side or use deception to manage the potential avenues for disruption. Consider the human timescales and present the strategy in easy to digest packages. What matters is that the results are achieved, not that everyone knows how clever the tactician is.
