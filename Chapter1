# Chapter 1: Introduction to strategy
Throughout my career I’ve been a part of numerous meetings supposedly defining strategies and I was never satisfied with the experience. I now realise that none of these meetings actually defined strategies. Over the years I’ve been part of groups creating mission statements, vision documents and 
objective and key result (OKR) statements. Over that time I’ve occasionally researched strategy and struggled to find anything written for technology or  business that wasn’t specifically a sales, marketing or social media strategy. That sets the scene for this book. This is the book I wished I’d found when I was trying to understand what strategy is and how it might be valuable to me and other engineers.

The purpose of this first chapter is to examine the definition of strategy. This chapter will look at some simple strategies and examples of using them and  introduce the concept of a grand strategy.

**The definition of strategy**

The dictionary definitions of strategy are unhelpful. There are several different dictionaries in use throughout the world their definitions of strategy run along these lines:

**strategy**

/ˈstratɪdʒi/

noun

1. a plan of action designed to achieve a long-term or overall aim.
"time to develop a coherent economic strategy"
2. the art of planning and directing overall military operations and movements in a war or battle.
"he was a genius when it came to military strategy"

This seems to suggest that a strategy is just a plan that spans a long time period or it’s only useful in the context of war. That doesn’t seem right. If that were true why would there be sales strategies, marketing strategies and technology strategies. If strategies were just plans then why aren’t project managers writing them?

As the oldest human organisation the military has developed and used strategies for much longer than anyone else which may be why it’s so prominent in dictionary definitions. Even if you're completely new to the concept of strategy you've probably heard of a couple of military strategies for example The Pincer Movement or the Trojan horse.

In military terms The Pincer Movement is an attack where an adversary is caught between two forces and forced to deal with both simultaneously and ideally fall into chaos or retreat, either way the adversary is removed from the objective.

Everyone knows the story of the Trojan horse. A besieging force left a giant horse statue as a tribute for the city they were besieging. Later that night after the statue was brought into the city soldiers snuck out who could open the gates and lead their forces to take the city.
The pincer movement and the Trojan horse are both characterised by the fact that they can be reused in similar situations to achieve the same results.

Perhaps a better definition of a strategy might be:

**An identifiable pattern of actions that when performed in similar conditions will achieve predictable results.**

**Applying military strategies in modern business**
Given the military's long history of working with strategy they are potentially a huge resource for us to draw upon when thinking about the problems we face in business.

Let’s start with the Pincer Movement. In technology our adversary is never an opposing force, it's a problem we need to overcome. Consider a problem on an e-commerce site. Customers are trying to place orders but they aren’t getting to a payment screen. The engineers would look in two or even three  places simultaneously. They would look at the application server logs looking for errors and at the data stores and or event messages to see if there are any problems persisting the transaction or any problems the next function has of trying to read that data.

By tackling the problem on two fronts the teams could whittle away at the problem piece by piece.

Considering problems as adversaries means many tried and tested strategies from military and business history become available. Let’s take a look at another example.

**Defensive Strategies**
There are defensive strategies as well as aggressive strategies. Consider a multi-layered network design that increases security by decreasing the attack vector with each layer of the network.

In its simplest implementation web sites are connected to the internet but only allow a single port to access them. They in-turn connect to applications via an API layer that only allows the web servers to connect on that same SSH port. These API servers are then the only servers allowed to connect to the data sources and again only on the port specifically configured for those data sources.
