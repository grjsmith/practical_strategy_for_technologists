# Chapter 3: The importance of strategy to a technology department

If a task is small a single person can just do it. If a task is larger and might take a team a couple of weeks then it needs a plan. If a task is large then several teams might need to work together over a few months and that requires several plans for several teams, some clever architecture and a programme. If a task is large enough that unforeseen circumstances might threaten its successful execution and there is an opportunity to imbue intelligent people with sufficient autonomy that they can counter disruptions at the right time with the right resources then it requires a strategy.

Consider a large task such as a digital transformation. Programmes like this tend to start small. Perhaps an individual team creates a new application designed to take advantage of modern capabilities. The team start with a relatively small and simple problem that could be solved with the existing technology stack but their goal isn’t just to solve the problem it’s to demonstrate that these sorts of problems can be solved more quickly and cheaply with new solutions and also to demonstrate how the organisation can achieve more sophisticated and more valuable objectives with new capabilities. This initiative could be part of a strategy but it could proceed without a strategy. It just needs a simple plan as it only involves a single team and they can fulfil their goal in a couple of months.

Once the new application is deployed and the technology stack is proven it can be adopted by other teams. Expanding the transformation out across multiple teams will need more plans and plans that need to be interwoven. A roadmap defining the next initiatives to adopt the new technology stack needs to be created. This roadmap needs to be created by people with sufficient context and perspective because the productivity of each new team adopting the new technologies for the first time will be reduced. This will require careful stakeholder management as it will take teams several weeks to become as confident with the new technology as they are with the old.

As candidates for migration to the new technology stack are identified, there will need to be some analysis of the new capabilities these candidates require. These capabilities will need to be prioritised inline with the adoption roadmap and will probably need to be built in partnership with the first team to consume them. This means that as well as lacking confidence in the new technology stack, adopting teams don’t even have all the features they need and they’ll probably have to help build those features.

The adopting teams will also need support from the first team to introduce the technology. Meanwhile that first team will be building new capabilities in the technology stack that will be needed by the teams solving more complex problems.

At this point we have just a few teams involved but the opportunities for disruption have multiplied. When the problem of building a new technology stack was constrained to a single team a good engineering manager and delivery manager could easily cope with the kinds of disruptions they might face. If they lose people they can hire more people or ask for someone from another team to join them. If a team member is difficult because they can’t express themselves constructively and compromise with their teammates, their performance can be managed. If one of the tools the team is using is more complicated than expected then plans can be adjusted to allow for investigation into different tools or just working through the complexity.

All those problems and more can happen in every team that adopts the new technology and ways of working, so every team needs a good delivery manager and engineering manager. If those were the only vectors of disruption then good management and good planning would be enough to solve even the largest and most complicated problems. Those are not the only kinds of problems large initiatives like this face.

Disruptions can come from outside the teams and outside the teams leadership. How will the digital transformation succeed when business functions outside of technology pressure teams for delivery of specific short term objectives? A team would have no choice but to split their work between old and new technology stacks because they don’t have the confidence to commit to deadlines with the new technology. The team will escalate the risk of disruption to their leadership but their leadership have no other tools but a plan and plans of plans that are constantly changing with which to prioritise the new requests. This escalates further until it reaches the CTO who needs to appeal to their peers to allow the digital transformation to proceed and this would happen for every disruption. That’s impractical and is just one example of why many large initiatives fail. This kills the team's morale. When teams each have their own plans which might be disrupted at any time by outside influences and when they can’t see how their plan interacts with other team’s plans or how they contribute to the organisation’s overall success, work becomes a daily grind. A strategy brings people together and gives them something to focus on. Discussing how your team’s plan is part of the strategy and hearing how other people's team’s plans  are also part of the strategy makes people feel that their work has purpose and meaning.

## The power of strategies is the power of stories

Crafted well, a strategy tells a science fiction story describing a possible future world that could be brought into being if only something was done differently. Stories are immensely powerful, a good story that’s told well will stick with people and will resonate in the mind returning unbidden again and again. This repetition further reinforces the story in the mind long after the story is finished. The same happens with strategies.

If strategies are to have this effect they must be presented in a similar way to a story. Much has been written on how to structure stories and a reader looking to create a strategy in their organisation would do well to do some basic research into the story-telling.

In its simplest form, a story opens with a description of the status quo, this is the context setting that establishes the conditions that exist at the beginning of the story. Usually the story starts with a boring humdrum situation or a dire existential threat that needs to be escaped. Either way the set up makes it clear that something must change. There is then a catalysing event, something happens that starts a change. There then follows a story of strife, difficulty, victories and losses. There’s then some supposedly final event where all seems lost before the final victory where the goal is achieved or at least some resolution is reached. Good strategies follow a similar pattern albeit with a little less drama and emotional manipulation.

Strategies allow people to find the best way to solve potentially catastrophic problems on their own without requiring re-planning, meetings with other teams or escalations. Military strategies are designed so that smaller, specialist groups can each do what they excel at. The work of each group supports the work of each other group. Each group is trusted to carry out its role, all the groups know what to expect from each other. As modern technology organisations have moved away from project based work and embraced mission-based teams they have unlocked this capability. Modern technology organisations have finally learned something the military realised more than a thousand years ago.

## Mission-based teams and microservices

One of the ways Just Eat was able to grow as fast as it did was that it  embraced mission-based teams. At Just Eat each function of the Just Eat product was owned by a product delivery team that developed a deep level of expertise in that function, its customers and the underlying technology needed to enable that function. This allowed each team to build just what they needed to build in order to deliver the right result. Teams could rely on each other to honour the API contracts they published and so it was safe for each team to extend their products as  needed. When a change to these contracts was needed, or more usually when a new capability was being delivered, the engineering managers for the teams had forums where they could announce these changes and educate the teams who were dependent on them. The product managers for these teams also had forums where they could discuss and announce how new capabilities were being delivered. The SRE team provided tools and infrastructure that allowed the product teams to implement solutions that made it easier for all the product teams to understand each others applications such as Source control solutions so everyone could read each other’s code and API contracts, configuration management solutions so everyone could run each other’s applications in test environments and logging and monitoring solutions that allowed everyone to find problems across the whole platform even though it was made up of different services. This Microservice strategy allowed Just Eat to scale its engineering capability horizontally and deliver tens of discrete capabilities simultaneously. Each team could optimise its services based on the customer requirements regardless of whether those customers were end-users buying takeaways or other product delivery teams who needed that service in order to provide services to end-users. Even quite complex problems could be solved by a handful of engineering managers meeting and just agreeing where the problem needed to be solved. The teams could then get on and do what they needed to do.

## Strategy can be used as a defence against disruption

The mere existence of a strategy can protect an initiative. In 2015 I took on the role of Head of Strategy for the DevOps division of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). For international readers unfamiliar with the structure of the British government the DWP is the largest government department. The DWP administers the State Pension and a range of working age, disability and ill health benefits to around 20 million claimants and customers. In 2015 many government departments had experimented with various niche pseudo-clouds; these were all aimed at appealing to the government. None of these solutions had the capability or performance of the public clouds. The US government had recently made a great fanfare of launching on Amazon’s cloud (AWS) and AWS were building capabilities aimed at making it possible for the British government to make use of their cloud. Our team was tasked with making it possible for any team of engineers, in the DWP, to build and launch their application using AWS but ensure it was done securely, and with sufficient governance that every penny spent could be allocated to an officially recognised project budget.

After defining our technology approach, building the team and establishing the ways of working my role was to defend the department from assault from the CTO and other groups from within the DWP. The CTO was a source of disruption because while we were trying to deliver his strategy he would frequently drop by to ask us if we had plans to implement this technology or that one. It wasn’t always clear where these suggestions originated from. A few of us had a suspicion that other teams were trying to sabotage our success using the CTO as a weapon by planting these ideas in his head. The reason other teams didn’t want us to succeed wasn’t malicious. There had been numerous, heavy-handed approaches to technology governance in the DWP in the preceding years. Each of these had led to organisations outside of the value stream making it difficult for those accountable for delivering services to do so. Disrupting central technology governance structures like ours was a defence mechanism for the teams accountable for trying to deliver services. They weren’t to know we were on their side, the previous teams trying to implement governance and controls probably said they were on their side too. While the CTO was dropping by with helpful suggestions various other teams would raise escalations that we were duplicating work, which is a cardinal sin in government as every civil servant is conscious that every penny is the tax payers not the governments. There were claims that our solutions weren’t secure or that we were delivering capabilities no one wanted or had asked for and a variety of other unfounded claims. There was never a need for any evidence to back these claims. Every claim needed investigation and a response. No one cared about or really even read the responses, it was only a problem if the claims weren’t sufficiently rebutted.

My director had the genius idea of using strategy to defend ourselves from these attacks after realising how much of his and his people’s time was being wasted on producing these rebuttals. The idea was that if we could create a strategy that encompassed security, financial probity  and user research then we could just re-use that strategy as our defence each time we were attacked and if someone was good enough to find a gap in our defences we could just plug that gap in the strategy rather than have to create a fully researched rebuttal. It was a great idea and it worked perfectly.

Alongside a fantastic Accenture consultant, Naomi Watts we researched various military, corporate and diplomatic strategies and structured and presented ours with elements from all of them. The idea was that what we produced should look credible. The content would be good too but we had no illusions that anyone would actually read it, other than our leadership. We knew what it was for when we were writing it. We included the latest position from Government Digital Services (GDS) on user research and wrote extensively how we were applying those techniques to internal customers, the engineers from all the different consultancies building services at the DWP. We wrote about how we would make the governance model transparent to engineers. If they had appropriate permissions, assigned by their own managers, then building cloud resources would automatically charge their projects with no additional work from them. We described the code quality and security solution and air-gapped deployment mechanism that was almost entirely automated, the “almost” in that sentence was a government requirement not a capability limitation. Finally I added a future section where we assessed the likely usefulness of every technology that the Thoughtworks tech radar and our partners at Accenture and IBM had ever examined. More importantly in this section we included the results of some of our user research showing our implementation ideas for all the technologies planned to be used by all the teams targeting a public cloud implementation. Finally we topped it off with one more thing that I think had a bigger impact than anything we wrote. We condensed the strategy into a handful of concise talking points and we shared them with all our people and talked about them constantly. The idea behind this was that if one of our people overheard someone from another team speculating about what we were doing or levelling unfounded criticisms then they could use one of these talking points to shut the point down before it was formally escalated and caused the need for an official response.

The result of all of this was that all the semi-legitimate challenges ceased, almost immediately. Various, previously standoffish teams, engaged with us and we spread our reach further. We delivered some genuinely useful and innovative solutions.

The DWP DevOps strategy wasn’t designed to bring teams together and to create a sense of shared purpose across multiple teams but it did that just by existing. By reinforcing convenient soundbite messaging it was communicated by gossip far more effectively than it ever was by email and presentations.

## Strategies at a small scale

Strategies are essential if large groups of people are going to be able to achieve a specific set of objectives over a medium to long period of time. There is another situation where strategies can be equally useful. Strategies can be very helpful to individuals or small groups looking to achieve specific objectives over long and very long periods of time. This book has been written with individual contributors and managers in mind as well as directors and c-level executives.

As shown above the key to a small group having a large effect, given enough time, is through the power of stories. A strategy, presented as a story with a small demonstration can have a huge impact in one of two ways. Either the small group uses the story and demonstration to convince an influential person to back their cause or the group convinces a large number of people of their cause. In both cases the influential individual or the large group of people will retell the story and in each retelling the idea will gather momentum. The only way a strategy differs from a story at this point is intent. A story’s intent is to entertain and perhaps educate. The intent behind a strategy is to change something in the world.

### Gamification of service quality at Just Eat

When I got joined Just Eat in 2016 there were already a couple of hundred micro services, which more than doubled by the time I left two and a half years later. I was initially brought in to help Just Eat with some reliability problems they were experiencing. The resolution of these problems led to all manner of changes, one of which was a realisation that while a microservice strategy helped ensure Just Eat could develop new capabilities and react to change quickly it also led to a tendency of allowing older services to get out of date. One of the leaders in the SRE team came up with the idea of a Scorecard application that would gather a bunch of metrics and facts about services and then give them a quality rating. I backed the idea thinking that we could use it to make a case for getting essential security patches prioritised. My vision was woefully inadequate. We, unknowingly implemented a gamification strategy. We built the Scorecard application and iterated on it and it took the engineering department by storm. Everyone wanted to have A grade services. We didn’t need to make cases for anything. When the Intel Spectre and Meltdown bugs needed patching we offered a little ghost icon on the scorecard to the first team to patch their service and the teams went crazy for it. Teams would compete with each other to see who could get an A grade service the fastest. Teams would boast on Slack about how a new service they just launched was A grade at launch! One small team who had no authority over anyone else changed the perception of what made a service high quality with a gamification strategy.

## Conclusion

Strategies are important to a technology organisation for a number of reasons:

- They give leadership and management additional tools to help ensure they achieve their objectives
- They can be expressed as stories that, in turn, can go viral and take residency in people’s heads further reinforcing the message of the strategy
- They allow intelligent people in prodct or mission-based teams scope to solve problems with whatever resources they have available without requiring expensive and time consuming planning and replanning exercises.
- They allow small groups of people to make changes that would otherwise be beyond their scope or capability.
