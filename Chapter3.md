# Chapter 3: The importance of strategy to a technology department

If a task is small a single person can just do it. If a task is larger and might take a team a couple of weeks then it needs a plan. If a task is large then several teams might need to work together over a few months. That requires several plans for several teams, some clever architecture and a programme. If a task is large enough that unforeseen circumstances might threaten its successful execution Then there is an opportunity to give intelligent people  sufficient autonomy that they can counter disruptions at the right time with the right resources. That requires a strategy.

Consider a large task such as a digital transformation. Programmes like this tend to start small. Perhaps a team creates a new application. The team start with a relatively small and simple problem. That problem could probably be solved with the existing technology. Their goal isn’t just to solve the problem thought. They intend to demonstrate that these sorts of problems can be solved more quickly and cheaply with new solutions. They also want to demonstrate how the organisation can achieve more sophisticated and more valuable objectives with new capabilities. This initiative could be part of a strategy but it could proceed without a strategy. It just needs a simple plan as it only involves a single team and they can fulfil their goal in a couple of months.

Once the new application is deployed and the technology stack is proven it can be adopted by other teams. Expanding the transformation across multiple teams will need more plans. These plans need to be interwoven so teams don't block each other. A roadmap defining the next initiatives to adopt the new technology stack needs to be created. This will require careful stakeholder management as it will take teams some time to become as confident with the new technology as they are with the old.

Candidate applications for migration to the new technology stack will need to be analysed. This analysis highlights what capabilities the application requires. This provides sequencing to the roadmap. There's no point building an application, with the new technology stack, when none of the data it needs is accessible. Adopting teams will also need support from the first team to introduce the technology. Meanwhile that first team will be building new capabilities in the technology stack that will be needed by the teams solving more complex problems.

At this point we have just a few teams involved but the opportunities for disruption have multiplied. When the problem of building a new technology stack was constrained to a single team a good engineering manager and delivery manager could easily cope with the kinds of disruptions they might face. If they lose people they can hire more people or ask for someone from another team to join them. If a team member is difficult because they can’t express themselves constructively and compromise with their teammates, their performance can be managed. If one of the tools the team is using is more complicated than expected then plans can be adjusted to allow for investigation into different tools or just working through the complexity.

All those problems and more can happen in every team that adopts new technologies and ways of working. Every team needs good delivery management and engineering management. If those were the only vectors of disruption then good management and good planning would be enough to solve even the largest and most complicated problems.

Disruptions can come from outside the teams. How will the digital transformation succeed when business functions outside of technology pressure teams for delivery of specific short term objectives? A team would have no choice but to split their work between old and new technology stacks because they don’t have the confidence to commit to deadlines with the new technology. The team will escalate the risk of disruption to their leadership but their leadership have no other tools but a plan and plans of plans. These plans need to constantly change to factor in all the new requests. This escalates further until it reaches the CTO who needs to appeal to their peers to allow the digital transformation to proceed and this would happen for every disruption. That’s impractical and is just one example of why many large initiatives fail.

Teams lose confidence in their leadership when they are regularly disrupted. This destroys morale. A strategy brings people together and gives them something to focus on. Discussing how your team’s plan is part of the strategy and hearing how other people's team’s plans fit in makes people feel that their work has purpose and meaning.

## The power of strategies is the power of stories

Crafted well, a strategy tells a science fiction story that describes a possible future world that could be brought into being if only something was done differently. Stories are immensely powerful, a good story that’s told well will stick with people and will resonate in the mind returning unbidden again and again. This repetition further reinforces the story in the mind long after the story is finished. The same happens with strategies.

If strategies are to have this effect they must be presented in a similar way to a story. Much has been written on how to structure stories and a reader looking to create a strategy in their organisation would do well to do some basic research into the story-telling.

In its simplest form, a story opens with a description of the status quo, this is the context setting that establishes the conditions that exist at the beginning of the story. Usually the story starts with a boring humdrum situation or a dire existential threat that needs to be escaped. Either way the set up makes it clear that something must change. There is then a catalysing event, something happens that starts a change. There then follows a story of strife, difficulty, victories and losses. There’s then some supposedly final event where all seems lost before the real final victory where the goal is achieved or at least some resolution is reached. Good strategies follow a similar pattern albeit with a little less drama.

Strategies allow people to find the best way to solve potentially catastrophic problems on their own without requiring re-planning, meetings with other teams or escalations. Military strategies are designed so that smaller, specialist groups can each do what they excel at. The work of each group supports the work of each other group. Each group is trusted to carry out its role, all the groups know what to expect from each other. As modern technology organisations have moved away from project based work and embraced mission-based teams they have unlocked this capability.

## Mission-based teams and microservices

One of the ways Just Eat was able to grow as fast as it did was that it  embraced mission-based teams. At Just Eat each function of the Just Eat product was owned by a product delivery team. These teams developed a deep level of expertise in their function, their customer behaviour and the underlying technology their function relied upon. This allowed each team to build just what they needed to build in order to deliver the right result. Teams could rely on each other to honour their API contracts and so it was safe for each team to extend their products as needed. When a change to these contracts was needed, or more usually when a new capability was being delivered, the engineering managers for the teams could announce the changes and educate the teams who were dependent on them. The SRE team provided tools and infrastructure that supported the teams. We made it easier for all the product teams to understand each others applications. We managed Source control solutions so everyone could read each other’s code and API contracts. We provided configuration management solutions so everyone could run each other’s applications in test environments. We provided observability solutions that allowed everyone to find problems across the whole platform even though it was made up of different services. This Microservice strategy allowed Just Eat to scale its engineering capability horizontally and deliver several discrete capabilities simultaneously. Each team could optimise its services based on the customer requirements regardless of whether those customers were buying takeaways, cooking takeaways or other product delivery teams. Even quite complex problems could be solved by a handful of engineering managers meeting and just agreeing where the problem needed to be solved. The teams could then get on and do what they needed to do.

This microservice strategy provided a guiding policy and some guidelines that allowed teams the freedom to do optimise their functions. It was almost never discussed because the narrative of it lived, rent-free, in everyone's heads.

## Strategy  as a defence against disruption

The mere existence of a strategy can protect an initiative. In 2015 I was Head of Strategy for the DevOps division of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). The DWP is the largest government department. The DWP administers the State Pension and a range of working age, disability and ill health benefits to 20 million people. The Government had experimented with various niche pseudo-clouds. None of these had the capability or performance of a public cloud. The US government had recently made a great fanfare of launching on Amazon’s cloud (AWS). AWS were building capabilities specifically aimed at appealing to governments. We were tasked with making sure any team, in the DWP, could build and launch their application using AWS. We had to ensure it was secure, and that every penny of cost was allocated to an officially recognised project budget.

We defined our technology approach. We built the team and established our ways of working. With all that done my role was to defend the initiative. The CTO was one potential source of disruption. While we were trying to implement his strategy he would occasionally drop by to ask us if we had plans for this technology or that. It wasn’t always clear where these suggestions originated from. We suspected that other teams were trying to sabotage our initiative using the CTO as a weapon. We wondered if they might be setting him up to disrupt us by planting ideas with him. The reason other teams didn’t want us to succeed wasn’t malicious. Government is famous for taking a heavy-handed approach to technology. Previous initiatives had led to centralised organisations, like ours, making it difficult to deliver services. Disrupting central technology governance structures, like ours, was a reasonable defence mechanism. They weren’t to know we were on their side, the previous teams trying to implement governance  controls probably said they were on their side too.

Disruption would come from other teams too. there were claims that that we were duplicating work. This is a cardinal sin in government. Every civil servant, I met, was obsessed with the idea that every penny we spent was tax payers money. There were claims that our solutions weren’t secure. We were also accused of delivering capabilities no one had asked for and a variety of other unfounded claims. There was never a need for any evidence to back these claims. Every claim needed investigation and a response. No one seemed to really care about the responses, it was only important that there was a response.

My boss had the genius idea of using a strategy to defend ourselves from these attacks. He  realised how much of his and his people’s time was being spent on producing these each of these responses. His idea was to create a strategy that could counter the most common claims. We could then expand on it to counter anything novel that came our way. If we were presented with a legitimate concern we could use the strategy to determine if that were something that should be within our remit. It worked perfectly.

Naomi Watts, a fantastic Accenture consultant, and I researched military, corporate and diplomatic strategies. We structured and presented ours using elements from all of them. We knew that in order for this approach to work the strategy should look credible. The content would be great too but we had no illusions that anyone would actually read it. Our leadership would be a tougher test of the content than any of the supposed audience. We included the latest position from Government Digital Services (GDS) on user research. We wrote about how we were applying those techniques to our internal customers, the project team engineers. We wrote about how we would make the governance model transparent to engineers. If an engineer had the right permissions then any cloud resources they built would be charged directly to their projects. We described the code quality, security scanning and air-gapped deployment mechanism.  We included a future section where we assessed the likely usefulness of every technology on the Thoughtworks tech radar and that our partners at Accenture and IBM had ever examined.  We also included the results of our user research. This showed our approach for all the technologies being considered by the project teams. Finally we topped it off with one more thing that had a bigger impact than anything else. We condensed the strategy into a handful of concise talking points. We shared these with all our people and our customers and talked about them constantly. If one of our people overheard someone from another team speculating about our work or levelling unfounded criticism then they could use one of these talking points to shut the point down before it was formally escalated and caused the need for an official response.

All the challenges ceased. Previously standoffish teams, engaged with us and we spread our reach further. We delivered some genuinely useful and innovative solutions.

The DWP DevOps strategy wasn’t designed to bring teams together and to create a sense of shared purpose across multiple teams but it did that just by existing. By reinforcing convenient soundbite messaging it was communicated by gossip far more effectively than it ever was by formal email and presentations.

## Strategies at a small scale

Strategies can also be useful to individuals or small groups looking to achieve outcomes over longer periods of time.

As shown above the key to a small group having a large effect, given enough time, is through the power of stories. A strategy, presented as a story with a small demonstration can have a huge impact in one of three ways. The small group uses the story and demonstration to convince an influential person to back their cause. The group convinces a large number of people to back their cause with a little effort now and then. This describes the open source movement. The third way uses the power of the story to keep the small group focused for long enough to achieve their outcome. The only way a strategy differs from a story at this point is intent. A story’s intent is to entertain and perhaps educate. The intent behind a strategy is to change something in the world.

### Gamification of service quality at Just Eat

When I got joined Just Eat in 2016 there were already a couple of hundred microservices. This more than doubled by the time I left two and a half years later. I was brought in to help with some reliability problems Just Eat were experiencing. The resolution of these problems led to all manner of changes. One change was a realisation that a microservice strategy led to a tendency for older services to fall out of date. One of the leaders in the SRE team, Bennie Johnson, came up with the idea of a Scorecard application. This would gather metrics and facts about all the services and give them a score. I backed the idea thinking that we could use it to make a case for getting essential security patches prioritised. My vision was woefully inadequate. We built the Scorecard application and iterated on it and it took the engineering department by storm! Everyone wanted to have A-grade services. We didn’t need to make cases for anything. When the Spectre and Meltdown bugs needed patching we offered a little ghost icon on the scorecard to the first team to patch their service. The teams went crazy for it. Teams would compete with each other to see who could get an A-grade service the fastest. Teams would boast on Slack about how a new service they just launched was A-grade at launch! One small team with no authority over anyone else changed what made a great service with a gamification strategy.

## Conclusion

Strategies are important to a technology organisations because:

- they give leadership and management a tool to help them achieve their objectives

- They can be expressed as stories. Stories can go viral and take up residency in people’s heads further reinforcing the message

- They allow people in product or mission-based teams to solve problems without requiring expensive and time consuming planning and replanning exercises

- They allow small groups of people to make changes that would otherwise be beyond their scope or capability.
