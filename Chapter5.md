# Chapter 5: Ancient strategies

This chapter will introduce some very simple strategies that were the mainstay of military commanders in ancient China. These can seem overly simple in a modern business context but they are the foundations upon which more complex strategies are built. A modern strategy might involve several of these strategies operating in series or in parallel. The strategies are presented individually here with  examples where they have been used them successfully.

The strategies were all chosen from the Thirty-Six Stratagems (Search Wikipedia for: Thirty-Six Stratagems).

## Remove the ladder when the enemy has ascended to the roof (上屋抽梯, Shàng wū chōu tī)

>With baits and deceptions, lure the enemy into treacherous terrain and cut off their lines of communication and escape routes. To save themselves, they must fight both one's own forces and the elements of nature.

Whenever you see terrain or a physical environment described in a military strategy replace the word terrain with intellectual position, or previously agreed upon approach, or strongly held opinion or mindset. This is the terrain knowledge workers operate on, this is why empathy is so powerful, it gives the strategist insight into the terrain other people are operating on.

Treacherous terrain equates to ideas that someone struggles to get around. An example of this is the developer who is adamant that a particular programming language is the only possible option even though the organisation can’t hire any developers with skills and experience in that language. The developer has a strong position, it can’t be attacked directly because they are so emotionally invested in it but the position has a clear weakness in that the organisation can’t grow it’s development capability in that language. At some point that developer will see that their position is weak. They won’t necessarily change their mind, some people struggle to do that even in the face of overwhelming evidence but the position has now changed to a performance management issue as opposed to a conflict of ideas.

This idea doesn’t just pertain to people, it also works with any immobile position. When the people, software or services that  oppose the strategy have a strongly held position then the strategist should counter it with an equally strong opinion but one that is weakly held. The strategist should be open to hearing how their idea won’t work and should feel empowered to question those who disagree with the idea. As long as the strategist actually listens to the opposing positions and doesn’t just spend the time thinking of what to say next. In this way the opposition manoeuvres themselves into a position where they have nowhere to go. That might not grant an immediate victory but over time people will begin to see the weaknesses in the opposing position.

This strategy specifically talks about attacking the enemy, in all the strategies that follow replace the word enemy with problem. As discussed previously, in modern business it’s very rare we have a defined enemy that we might attack in the way the military does but we definitely have problems that we want to overcome.

## Make a sound in the east, then strike in the west (聲東擊西, Shēng dōng jī xī)

>In any battle the element of surprise can provide an overwhelming advantage. Even when face-to-face with an enemy, surprise can still be employed by attacking where they least expect it. Create an expectation in the enemy's mind through the use of a feint. Manipulate the enemy to focus their resources somewhere before attacking elsewhere that is poorly defended. Tactically, this is known as an "open feint".

In some respects this strategy describes the importance of having a strategy. If the problem being tackled is defined well enough the edges of the problem will become clear and that will indicate the best place to start tackling it. That doesn’t mean that problems should always be tackled at the edges. If there are few edges that might be the right answer, if there are many edges sometimes it pays to start in the middle. Equally not all edges are created equal, a specific strength or weakness might also provide a useful guide. Complex problems that are made up of elements of people, process and technology will have several fronts and attempting to just solve one problem at a time will likely cause the problem to mutate. A good example of this is found in many product transformation initiatives. Many businesses are waking up to the power of product management. Somebody in the organisation wants to move away from being project led and move to being product led. This is a problem with many fronts and if tackled in just one place the problem will mutate.

One of the problems faced by project based organisations is that value is often poorly understood. Usually value is only understood as direct sales and so it’s very difficult to get funding for initiatives that don’t lead to directly easily attributed revenue growth. This makes it difficult to justify unproven experiments. Attacking these two problems can lead people to think that there is a chicken and egg problem. In other words, to prove that experimentation can lead to increased sales means the funding is needed to buy an experimentation tool and the developers to build it into the product. That’s a deadlocked position and tackling any one end of that problem just causes the problem to get more difficult.

In order to be successful either a sponsor with enough political power is needed to break the deadlock or both problems need to be tackled simultaneously. The finance organisation and the c-suite that empower it need to be educated with a more nuanced understanding of value, that can make way for outcome based budgeting rather than project based budgeting and the power of experimentation needs to be demonstrated to the organisation. Experimentation doesn’t require an experimentation tool, particularly if the experiment is a proof-of-concept designed to demonstrate the value of experimentation.

If the finance problem is tackled head-on months of effort will be expended for no measurable gain and momentum will be lost. If the experimentation problem is tackled head-on time and people will be spent against an ever increasing problem space as more and more demands are made.

By defining several tactical objectives the strategist can choose where to expend their effort and that of their teams on an hour-by-hour basis based on where the greatest advantages present themselves and the successes can be used as distractions for the next actions and momentum can be built which will improve the morale of the organisation which in turn makes success more likely.

This is a strategy that works well with other strategies such as a borrowed knife and partner with an ally with both of you using the other's successes to buy time, build morale, demonstrate value and provide cover.

At Zoopla merely having a strategy put me at an advantage. I could use it to keep the staff motivated, I could use it to identify two way doors, and opportunities, I could use it to reassure my leadership when they were nervous about making a decision. When I was frustrated by challenges on one front I could turn my focus to one of my other objectives and make progress there. This was possible because I had a strategy and I could accept friction in one area and even allow some smaller problems to work themselves out while I tackled problems elsewhere that might even provide a boost in those more difficult areas.

## Deceive the heavens to cross the sea (瞞天過海, Mán tiān guò hǎi)

>Mask one's real goals from those in authority who lack vision by not alerting them to one's movements or any part of one's plan.

This is a cautionary tale about moving too quickly. Sometimes time can be used as an ally. If the strategist has formed a strategy and problems are being tackled on multiple fronts then the strategist can choose when to tackle each aspect of each problem. When an organisation decides to change something about itself like a product transformation or a digital transformation there will be people who have an emotional attachment to the current way of working or a general negative disposition to change. Neither of these positions are necessarily unreasonable. I don’t say that to be diplomatic, it’s true, the people who have seen changes fail have useful experience that should be listened to. However these positions apply a friction against the change the organisation wants to make and so they need to be resolved. Moving quickly and attempting to resolve these issues head-on is more likely to cause these people to feel cornered and react more emotionally, not less. Taking a calm approach and listening, while making small cautious changes that take some of these people’s concerns into account will be more productive than a series of emotional debates. If necessary these moves can be distractions and false fronts while momentum is built for a bigger push. The sunk cost fallacy can be used to the strategists advantage here.

A great way to do this in organisations is for the strategist to hide their intent behind an alternative motive. If the challenge is to orchestrate a reorganisation, the strategist should take on a role inside the organisation. They should learn first-hand what the problems are. They should decide for themselves if the re-organisation will really solve the problems that are perceived to exist. Too many reorganisations are perceived by the people in the organisation as unnecessary because they don’t see the problems the leadership see. By operating inside an organisation the strategist will learn the language of the organisation. If that experience leads them to conclude that a reorganisation is needed they can even start the change management and communications activities while they are still operating inside the organisation. If very successful they can convince the people within the organisation that change is needed.

If you’re reading this and you think this is duplicitous and dishonest then consider that it would be impossible to fully empathise with the people in the organisation as an outsider.

## Besiege Wèi to rescue Zhào (圍魏救趙, Wéi Wèi jiù Zhào)

>When the enemy is too strong to be attacked directly, attack something they cherish. The idea is to avoid a head-on battle with a strong enemy, and instead strike at their weakness elsewhere. This will force the strong enemy to retreat in order to support their weakness. Battling against a tired and dispirited enemy will give a much higher chance of success.

In the military context this strategy is presented in it suggests that When attempting to achieve something ambitious it's worth considering setting up some alternative objectives to draw attention away from the main goal.

This is very helpful in a modern business context too. Not because we’re trying to fool people  but because there might be multiple routes we can use to achieve our objective and we don’t want to plan ourselves into a corner. Instead we want to retain the flexibility we need to achieve the desired outcome.

Marketing, finance, customer service functions and the technology leaders that need to manage expectations with these stakeholders are uncomfortable with the level of ambiguity we live with in technology. No matter how many times people attempt to create analogies where they equate software engineering with assembly line manufacturing or the building industry it isn’t like either of those industries. As much as we try to rely on open standards, open source, software and platform-as-a-service offerings there is still an aspect of bespoke, artisanal code that is subject to ambiguity. We need room to find our way to answers while appearing like we’re working to a fully worked out plan.

The goal of the strategist should be to establish multiple routes to achieve the desired outcomes and structure the implementation such that it can quickly switch between these routes. This gives the flexibility needed to achieve success and allows the strategist to be able to give ground pragmatically without sacrificing anything meaningful. Many initiatives have been sabotaged because a single change to the approach is deemed as evidence of a failure or poor management. This approach is a defence against this.

This is a practical reason to ensure a system architecture has some form of anti-corruption layer. Be that an API Gateway, Super Graph or even just an easily manageable routing layer that gives control over web and mobile traffic. This gives the flexibility needed to ensure that if one approach doesn’t work out it can be changed in isolation without impacting all the other teams involved.

## Kill with a borrowed knife (借刀殺人, Jiè dāo shā rén)

>Attack using the strength of another when in a situation where using one's own strength is not favourable. For example, trick an ally into attacking them or use the enemy's own strength against them. The idea is to cause damage to the enemy via a third party.

Sometimes the right thing to do is to forge alliances and sometimes the right thing to do is to use others strengths without them being aware of it. In a strictly technological context we do this all the time, this is why we use open source software, when we do this we forge an alliance with a bunch of skilled and committed engineers we don’t even know. Inside the organisation the strategist should always look for people who share their goals and values. More can be achieved as teams than can be achieved as individuals; this becomes a strategy when the strategist chooses to tie the success of their initiative to that of other teams and organisations.

Before the strategist identifies their strategy they need to take stock of the resources and people available to them. Where there are obvious weaknesses it first needs to be determined if these weaknesses can be fortified. If not it needs to be seen if the weakness can be transmuted into a strength and finally if neither of those are possible the strategist needs to find strength from elsewhere. Transmuting a weakness into a strength is a more complex topic and will be discussed in the next chapter.  Here we see how we can borrow other’s strengths.

Search Engine Optimisation teams (SEO) make great allies when building web services, they’re sometimes seen as a necessary evil by technology organisations because they are more closely aligned to the marketing organisation. Business Intelligence and Analytics functions make useful allies particularly if the strategist is implementing some sort of centralised event system. Event systems are great places for BI and Analytics teams to harvest real-time operational data. Product Marketing teams are powerful allies that the strategist can benefit from in the run up to a launch event. Product Marketing knows everyone and they can make a steering committee really productive. In all of these cases the strategist has something they can offer to these allies in return for their support. To SEO the strategist building web services can encapsulate all of the functional SEO requirements in the new build where they take up very little additional time. To BI teams the strategist can offer access to real-time raw data with auditable provenance. To Product Marketing the strategist is a source of truth about what is coming and when.

## Wait at leisure while the enemy labors (以逸待勞, Yǐ yì dài láo)

>It is advantageous to choose the time and place for battle while the enemy does not. Encourage the enemy to expend their energy in futile quests while one conserves their strength. When the enemy is exhausted and confused, attack with energy and purpose.

Most of the problems strategists need to solve are large and complicated and involve people, politics, culture, technology and processes. These aren’t the sort of problems that can be tackled head-on or all at once. Cunning strategists look for the problems that will take the longest to resolve and, if possible, start with them, then they look for opportunities to tackle the other problems along the way. Culture, politics and people usually take the longest to change so it’s often a good idea to choose strategies for these first even if the primary goal is to introduce some functional change. This is where the strategist chooses their battlefields. This strategy is most effective when the people who need to change don’t have a strategy.

When designing the strategy the strategist should start by imaging what the end result will look like to the various stakeholders within the organisation. This is where the essays we wrote at school will be useful. Imaging what it would be like to be a peasant in the middle ages or imagining what it would be like to be a soldier in the trenches in the first world war was good training for imaging what life will be like for a software engineer, a director of technology or a product marketer in the organisation after the changes have been made.

Designing this end result allows the strategist to work backwards through the delta between this future world and the current one. Will engineers deploy whenever their tests have passed? If so, what stops them from doing that now? Is it just the lack of the appropriate tools or is there a command and control function blocking deploys? Are there compliance and governance teams demanding manual checks? Are the teams taking accountability for the performance and reliability of the software they build?

Working through questions helps define all the problems that the strategy needs to solve. If any of these problems are created by the way people think about problems or fear, uncertainty and doubt the strategy must start addressing these as quickly as possible. The best way to deliver transformation is through delivery. If an organisation is embarking on a public cloud for the first time, deliver a system architecture diagram and engage the security team in a threat modelling exercise early. If an organisation is using some new software they haven’t used before, get it into production as soon as possible, even if it’s just doing something trivial and regularly report on its successes. This all might seem like a technical exercise but it isn’t, it’s a cultural and human change management exercise. People are most afraid and uncertain about what they don’t understand. The strategist should look for as many early proofs of their strategy as they can. People’s natural adaptability will do the rest. Within a couple of weeks what was once frightening will become commonplace.

## Loot a burning house (趁火打劫, Chèn huǒ dǎ jié)

>When a country is beset by internal problems, such as disease, famine, corruption, and crime, it is poorly-equipped to deal with an outside threat. Keep gathering internal information about an enemy. If the enemy is in its weakest state, attack them without mercy and annihilate them to prevent future troubles.

When a team is embattled and struggling that's when they are most susceptible to being helped.

Sometimes the biggest barrier to change is the teams within an organisation who have decided that they have no reason to change. There are any number of reasons why they have decided they don’t need to change. Maybe they think they’ve seen all this before and didn’t need change then and don’t need it now. Perhaps there was a recent re-organisation that didn’t fundamentally change anything and so they have decided that all change is pointless. It may be that they have seen other teams go through a similar change and they don’t perceive any material difference.

The challenge in these situations is either to make them realise the pain that they are in or to put them in pain.

Humans are very adaptable and will normalise bad situations. Sometimes all that’s needed is to show people that their lives can be better with some changes. This can be done in a few different ways. The strategist can work alongside them and point out some of the problems in the hope that the people in the team see that those things are problems and they’ll engage with trying to design solutions. Another approach is to put them in pain and offer the solution. Teams in modern organisations are usually one part of a greater whole where their function is dependent on upstream functions and has commitments to downstream functions. If a team is sticking to their guns that they don’t need change then the strategist can focus on the teams around them. Helping the upstream and downstream teams offer a wider range of capabilities and improved performance to their stakeholders. This will put pressure on the recalcitrant teams to adapt to those new capabilities. This can force the need for change even on the most stubborn teams.

## Openly repair the gallery roads, but sneak through the passage of Chencang (明修棧道，暗渡陳倉, Míng xiū zhàn dào, àn dù Chéncāng)

>Deceive the enemy with an obvious approach that will take a very long time, while ambushing them with another approach. It is an extension of the "Make a sound in the east, then strike in the west" tactic, but instead of merely spreading misinformation to draw the enemy's attention, physical decoys are used to further misdirect the enemy. The decoys must be easily seen by the enemy to draw their attention while acting as if they are meant to do what they are falsely doing to avoid suspicion.

This strategy contains two lessons for strategists. Solving problems requires the careful management of information and a wealth of opportunities become available if the strategist can manage the tension between solving problems directly and indirectly at the same time.

I have numerous examples of organisations who have chosen to invest in a new technology approach and full of enthusiasm they start talking excitedly about how wonderful the new world will be without giving a thought to how dismissed and spurned the people who have worked hard on the current tech stack will feel. The most mobile of those people will move on and those left behind will become embittered and will adopt a siege mentality. This isn’t healthy for them or for the organisation as a whole and at worst they can cause significant disruption to the new approach without really even meaning to.

Transformation seems to be an essential part of business. There are businesses who manage to maintain a steady rate of change and investment but in my experience it’s far more common for businesses to transition between investment and exploitation phases. These investment phases are often transformations as organisations adopt cloud or software-as-a-service approaches, or newer languages and frameworks or new approaches to getting insight from data.

While it might be a desired goal that old approaches be entirely swept away by a wave of new technology more often than not the actual result is that the new technology delivers the required results and the work is not done to migrate and close down those older solutions that just continue to work. It’s important that those people who know the older tech stacks are valued and treated with respect. As such the way transformation is talked about needs to be managed. It is important that business stakeholders and investors have hope and confidence in a brighter future with more flexibility but it’s just as important that the present reality is faced. Too often the technology that generates all the revenue is known as legacy. The way transformation is discussed needs to be carefully managed so the message to the technology team is one of hope and investment in new approaches that will deliver different capabilities and different results but that older technology that still underpins parts of the business are managed and optimised for their new role in which they don’t receive the lion’s share of the development effort.

A number of tactics can be employed to enact this strategy in the context of a business transformation:

Recognising that the existing tech is probably not going to be replaced in any foreseeable timescale it needs to be optimised for its new role as do the teams who will maintain it. This first requires an optimisation and then a shift to a maintenance mode. As this technology stack is no longer going to be the primary focus of engineering it needs to be easy to maintain. There are a number of ways to do this while also enabling the shift to a new technology stack. It’s likely the old technology stack has poor test coverage and only a rudimentary build and deploy pipeline. Now is the time for making small changes with short bursts of effort and using processes and standard operating procedures to reduce the effort required to maintain the old technology.

Ensure the team supporting the existing technology feels important and valued. They are but it’s easy during the excitement of preparing for a transformation to make those teams feel undervalued and ignored. The way to do this is to make them consultants for the transformation. They are experts in the business domain and have a wealth of experience of the unique difficulties faced when building technology in this business. The new technology being built will likely rely on some elements of the old stack, at the very least it probably needs the data from it, even if it doesn’t want to use the old data stores. The team most familiar with the existing technology stack and its data are best placed to help build whatever solutions are needed to ensure both technologies can work side-by-side. My preferred approach to this is to modify the code that writes to the old data stores to also create events on topics in an event/log streaming solution like EventBridge or Kafka.

Ensure the teams who are going to maintain the existing tech are kept busy. They should start by codifying standard operating procedures. A handful of important end to end tests should be added. The maintenance team should provide consultancy to the new initiative reviewing the new technology approaches. Where people in the maintenance team are keen they should be trained on the new technology stack and if time allows should temporarily join the teams building the new technology so they can put their training into practice.

## Watch the fires burning across the river (隔岸觀火, Gé àn guān huǒ)

>Delay entering the field of battle until all other parties become exhausted by fighting amongst each other. Go in at full strength and finish them off.

In large organisations it’s not uncommon to find multiple teams whose remits overlap. There’s often some confusion about exactly what architects do in an organisation that also has principal engineers. Security, audit, compliance and data governance teams will often coexist in organisations and there often aren’t clear distinctions defining where one team’s accountability stops and another starts. In worst case scenarios these teams might claim no accountability and that their role is that of critic rather than contributor.

The strategist should always expect to engage with these teams but a cunning strategist will choose when and where that engagement should take place. It’s always wise to meet these teams early and develop a familiarity with them. The strategist should aim to learn these team’s pain points and understand what they perceive the problems facing the organisation are. If these team’s goals align closely with those of the transformation then the strategist will have some powerful allies if they manage the relationships well. If these teams goals do not align with those of the leadership then the strategist needs to take a great deal of care to ensure their initiative doesn’t get blocked.

Someone new to strategy, change programmes or transformation may not recognise this for the problem it is. They might assume that if some teams aren’t aligned to the leadership’s vision then escalation will solve the problem. The root cause of this lack of alignment is often because the technology leadership don’t have experience of dealing with these sorts of teams and might consider them as a necessary function that takes place after the software has been built or might just ignore them until an application has to go live. In organisations like this the entire burden for satisfying the architecture, security, audit, compliance and governance teams falls on a product delivery team who thought their job was just to write some software. This is a frustrating and painful situation that frustrates all parties. The people in the middle of this situation are not in the best place to resolve it. The architecture, audit, governance, security and compliance teams will often resort to saying that they should be engaged earlier in the software development lifecycle. What that doesn’t address is helping a product delivery team understand how to get the most value out of these teams.

Watching the fires burning across the river suggests that one way to solve this problem is to engage these teams early. Having engaged the teams the strategist should be looking to distil clear, testable requirements from these teams. The strategist should explain that the goal is to build an automated test capability that provides constant auditable assurance that regulations and compliance requirements are being met each time software is built and released. In order to do this the strategist will explain that these teams need to work together to create the requirements to inform these automated tests. That creates the space required for the next phase of the delivery. As requirements come out from this group of teams they can be added to an appropriate pipeline stage. If the teams push back because their role is to review and criticise implementations as opposed to leading on the requirements necessary to comply with regulations and satisfy audits that is the time to escalate. No leadership team wants to hear that teams exist merely to offer consultancy to other teams.

## Hide a knife behind a smile (笑裏藏刀, Xiào lǐ cáng dāo)

>Charm and ingratiate oneself with the enemy. When their trust is gained, move against them in secret.

This is a simple parable about guarding the true vision carefully. Sometimes an organisation wants to achieve a result but its people aren’t able to conceive of the steps needed to get there. Attacking sacred ideals head-on won't achieve anything. Smiling and accepting the difficulties that can't be surmounted yet allows the strategist the space and time to enact their strategy.

In order to successfully communicate something an audience has to be capable of receiving and engaging with the message as well as the message being crafted for that audience. This means that communicating a vision or a strategy in its entirety might not be possible and worse it could backfire and cause the initiative to fail before it’s even begun. This is particularly true in an organisation where the people are suffering, have undergone significant upheaval or have been trying to transform and reinvent themselves and failing. People in this state are in no position to hear about another grand vision. They can consider a small number of immediately practical activities that will resolve some of their immediate pain points or concerns. Once the team is through that process they can hear a little more, such as how the changes that have just been successfully delivered (and celebrated) will be leveraged for a new small initiative. With that safely underway and the team energised by recent successes they might be in a position to hear about the next goal. It isn’t until the team has gained a measure of self-confidence born from seeing the real-world impact of their recent successes that they can be in a position to think about strategy.

In this strategy our enemy is still a problem, it isn't the people in the organisation. The enemy is the psychological safety of our people.

## Sacrifice the plum tree to preserve the peach tree (李代桃僵, Lǐ dài táo jiāng)

>There are circumstances where short-term objectives must be sacrificed in order to gain the long-term goal. This is the scapegoat strategy where someone suffers the consequences so that the rest do not.

When designing the strategy the strategist must ensure there is sufficient flexibility to allow it to continue to make progress towards the required outcomes even if it suffers setbacks. A strategy that offers no flexibility will fail at the first crisis.

The master strategist will create a strategy that contains acceptable sacrifices built in that still allows the most important outcomes to be achieved. This does not mean that the strategy should contain unnecessary outcomes. They would be easily seen through and render the strategist untrustworthy. Nor does this mean adding fat to the plan so headcount could be easily cut, that is also easily seen through and other departments will be doing that. Instead scope the outcomes such that solutions ranging from ideal to good enough are possible. The strategy must be able to continue successfully regardless of which implementation is chosen at each stage. In technical terms each tactical approach within the strategy should be only loosely coupled to the other tactics. That way if it’s necessary to compromise one or more tactical approaches it isn’t necessary to change the whole strategy. Take careful note of that word scope. Don’t plan all those approaches; define a strategic approach that you know will give you flexibility in multiple places when it’s time to implement the solution or modify the approach.

## Take the opportunity to pilfer a goat (順手牽羊, Shùn shǒu qiān yáng)

>While carrying out one's plans, be flexible enough to take advantage of any opportunity that presents itself, however small, and avail oneself of any profit, however slight.

In sacrificing the plum tree to preserve the peach tree the strategist designs their strategy to be resilient to undesirable changes. In being prepared to pilfer a goat the strategist designs their strategy such that opportunities can be taken advantage of.

This strategy and the previous one highlight the importance of having a strategy at all. Plans alone are seldom resilient enough to withstand the trials and tribulations that occur in a large organisation over a significant period of time. However a well developed strategy supported by several loosely coupled plans can withstand an enormous amount of change and still ensure teams are headed in the right direction.

One of the problems Zoopla’s technology department faced back in 2018 is one faced by many organisations. They had drawn a line between network infrastructure and software engineering and designed their solutions accordingly and the industry had moved on and that line was now in the wrong place.

Zoopla's tech stack used a network traffic routing solution that was managed by the infrastructure team because it relied on a language and operating paradigm that was unfamiliar to the software engineering teams. This was a relatively small problem but compounded with a bunch of other relatively small problems it created a perception of blocking teams.

Part of the outcome I was trying to achieve was to empower the software engineers with managing the routing of the web traffic so they had complete control of launching and decommissioning applications themselves. This had the benefit of creating clear accountability where the teams building apps were entirely accountable for the performance and availability of those apps.

It was becoming obvious that the way I wanted to do this wouldn’t work because we weren’t going to be allowed to migrate all the web pages to the new application framework. I was in the process of figuring out how to work around this when my hand got forced.

One of the team members committed us to replacing the site header across all the different web technology stacks to show support for Pride month. Something that would have required manual work across an uncertain number of pages on three different web technologies. Something we had been trying to avoid by moving everything to one solution. Now with a fixed deadline and my ideal solution impossible we needed to find another way.

After a short discussion we choose to use an old approach called Server Side Injection (SSI). The very network traffic routing solution that allowed these three web technologies to work together at all could also inject a new header and footer on to each page. We could build that new header and footer in the technology we wanted to use. Further we could deploy it using our chosen pipeline. There was some unfortunate manual clunkiness needed to tell the routing solution that there was a new header to inject when we wanted to change it but that could be automated later as time allowed.

Facing all the constraints and solving the problem had a number of positive knock-on effects. Our project to improve the technology got a huge boost across the business as people saw us do something that had proven impossible before. In embracing the routing solution and showing that we could work with it using the technologies that we wanted to use we identified further opportunities to use it to great effect. We demystified that technology for a lot of the engineers and later when the pandemic hit and we were forced to make more changes to the programme we could accept it as a good enough solution when the migration work we wanted to do was de-scoped.

## Stomp the grass to scare the snake (打草驚蛇, Dǎ cǎo jīng shé)

>Do something unaimed, but spectacular ("hitting the grass") to provoke a response from the enemy ("startle the snake") to have them give away their plans or position. Do something unusual, strange, and unexpected to arouse the enemy's suspicion and disrupt their thinking. It is more widely used as a warning: "[Do not] startle the snake by hitting the grass". An imprudent act will give one's position or intentions away to the enemy.

The strategist doesn’t always have to be the one to stomp the grass. The strategist pays close attention to all situations around the business. They study the impacts of changes in different places to learn who might be an ally and who might be an adversary. The strategist remembers Sun Tsu’s advice about the general who makes many calculations.

It isn't always easy to know how people will react to a strategy. It's worth forming sallies, semi serious smaller less ambitious goals to determine who are allies and adversaries and what their response might be. Use stories to test out ideas. I use statements like “in other companies in similar situations I’ve seen this approach work” this allows someone to support the idea or tell you when that was tried in this organisation and why it didn’t work. Either way I’ve learned something useful.

Architecture patterns are useful for this. At Zoopla the processing of listings data from estate agents is the core of the business. When I was there it  was also the oldest part of the technology stack. The paradigms being used to process the data were very old. When solving that problem today no one would build what was there. Once I understood what it was doing and how it worked it seemed obvious to suggest that the team investigate an event-driven architecture for processing this data. I would have loved to have the team embrace the idea with gusto and get on with it, it would have made later challenges easier. While some of the team embraced the idea and others were cautious the idea was rejected by the leader of that team and the leadership made no moves to support the idea either. While I was disappointed I learned a lot about what sort of ideas Zoopla would back and what they wouldn’t. This allowed me to reshape my strategy to achieve the outcomes I needed to achieve.

Loosely coupled plans linked to an overall strategy allowed me to be successful even though the Listings team were the snake I startled in the grass. This was the event that cemented, in my mind, the way I would suggest or propose approaches from this point forward. Even though I couldn’t modernise Listing processing I was able to modernise Search, which is the place where those listings start being valuable. The Search team could make requests of the Listings team to make small changes to make Search more effective which still allowed the overall programme and the strategy to be successful even if I didn’t get everything all my own way.

## Borrow a corpse to resurrect the soul (借屍還魂, Jiè shī huán hún)

>Take an institution, a technology, a method, or even an ideology that has been forgotten or discarded and appropriate it for one's own purposes.

In an organisation struggling under the weight of years of bad decisions or lack of decisions progress can’t be made by joining the throng of people complaining. Every solution suggested will have been tried before. It doesn't matter that the solution was tackled in a different context or by different people or with different technology there will always be naysayers who will argue with any proposal and no evidence will persuade them.

A better strategy is to find something to praise, something specific about the old implementation either something innocuous but that brings people on-side so they can be probed for helpful suggestions they might back or find something genuinely good and useful that can genuinely form part of a new approach. The strategist will usually find people who agree and further will agree that its implementation was lacking or abandoned early; this then can form the kernel of change.

At Just Eat, back in 2016, there were significant reliability problems in part caused by core parts of the service relying on a central relational database which had been physically scaled as far as it practically could be and was now just not structurally right to support the scale of the business.

A messaging solution had been built and partially implemented that could form the core of an event-driven architecture. Importantly the person who had the original vision for the event driven architecture and who had written some of the first parts of the messaging library was still at Just Eat. He was in a senior position and was widely respected by engineers and leaders and was expected to continue to rise. This event-driven architecture was the key to reducing the workload on the central database. The more transactions we could push into the events system the less those transactions had to hit the old central database. I didn’t need to engage in any falsehood, not only was the design of the event system good, the guy who spearheaded it was genuinely good too and a nice person to work with. All I needed to do was to point out that this was the right solution. Identify those expensive transactions that would make the most difference to database performance and then get those pieces of work on to the backlogs of the teams who owned the relevant parts of the system.

It’s a stretch to say that Just Eat’s messaging system was a corpse but it wasn’t appreciated as much as it should have been and raising its profile was significantly easier and led to faster progress than trying to introduce a new solution. It also offered me the opportunity to create a useful alliance with a powerful ally that I enjoyed working with.

## Lure the tiger down the mountain (調虎離山, Diào hǔ lí shān)

>Never directly attack an opponent whose advantage is derived from their position. Instead, lure them away from their position to separate them from their source of strength.

The status quo is an easily defensible position. The type of organisation the strategist will find themselves in is usually generating significant revenue from it’s existing systems but is looking to introduce some change. There will be many people who see no need for change because the business is doing just fine as it is. Reaching these people is very difficult if not impossible. Rather than attempt to bring them from their position to yours the best approach is to have them voluntarily come to your position because the weakness of their position becomes obvious to them.

A great example of this strategy in action is the DevOps movement. For decades development attacked operations by pushing deadlines and blaming ops for launch delays. In return operations would attack development for not honouring deadline commitments and providing properly tested software in time. Both were entrenched positions. Developers were late because scope wasn't adequately managed and genuine unforeseeable complications. Ops were entrenched because they provided out of hours cover and managed all the esoteric systems the Developers didn't want to. This led to decades of fighting with no clear resolution.

The deadlock was broken when developers realised that the modern world required that they had to run what they built and operations realised they needed to help developers by providing tools and platforms that weren't easy for developers to provide for themselves.

This is a huge simplification of a decade long transformation across an entire industry but it is what happened. Both parties lured each other out of their entrenched positions and both parties won.

## Remove the firewood from under the pot (釜底抽薪, Fǔ dǐ chōu xīn)

>Take out the leading argument or asset of someone; "steal someone's thunder". This is the essence of the indirect approach: instead of attacking enemy's fighting forces, direct attacks against their ability to wage war. Literally, take the fuel out of the fire.

Many companies have got themselves into a boom and bust cycle of innovation and exploitation They campaign for years to get budget and permission to spend some of their energy on their technology, then, if they’re lucky they get 9-24 months of innovation before they are then forced to spend the next 5-6 years exploiting whatever they’ve been able to innovate in the time they were given.

In recent years I’ve helped two organisations migrate from vanilla Javascript with Handlebars to React. React is just Javascript. React and vanilla Javascript can coexist. There’s no reason to down tools and spend 6 months building React pages. It is perfectly possible to invest a small portion of energy and budget to introduce a new approach and then manage a gradual migration where that makes the most sense and delivers the most value.

I’ve seen the same problem in the data space. Data Mesh is a modern approach that allows building pipelines and product specific data marts to deliver targeted insight from data. It’s not necessary to spend a year building an almighty data warehouse with a single data model in order to achieve business insights. A small team can build a data pipeline, process some data and deliver business insights in just a few weeks.

Technology has never been more interoperable than it is now. It’s no longer necessary to stop the world when it’s time to invest in technology. There can be no better success than the one no one was expecting. Implementing something small that interoperates well with the old and the new technologies removes the fuel from arguments about the cost of investing. A common problem new leaders find themselves in is that the only way forward they can see is to stop everything and build it all again from scratch or to make no significant immediate change and attempt to get some results by gradually changing the behaviours of the people involved. There is a third way, use the most modern approaches to build small, immutable systems that can be quickly launched, tested and decommissioned for almost no costs. There are a lot of Platform As A Service (PAAS) offerings that can require very little in the way of code to make them work. At Marks and Spencer we tried a new approach to serving the new web site we were building by using a new platform-as-a-service offering, instead of the traditional content delivery network (CDN) doing so, reduced the infrastructure as code by nearly 3000 lines. At the time of writing it remains to be seen whether we’ll use this in production but some of the benefits were immediately obvious.

## Befriend a distant state and strike a neighbouring one (遠交近攻, Yuǎn jiāo jìn gōng)

>Invading nations close to oneself carries a higher chance of success. The battlefields are close to one's domain and as such is easier for one's troops to receive supplies and defend the conquered land. Make allies with nations far away from oneself, as it is unwise to invade them.

When I joined Zoopla the engineers were unhappy about a great many aspects of engineering. They felt powerless to change many of these things because each thing they were unhappy with had been put in place by people who weren’t actually motivated by the same things as they were.

Motivation is a tricky thing, if you had asked anyone on the product and tech floor if their primary motivation was to deliver great products quickly they would have immediately agreed. However when I analysed their behaviours it quickly became clear that was not necessarily the primary motivation at play.

The infrastructure team were adamant that all the engineers use the Jenkins pipeline they provided and that all the problems people had with it were PEBKAC (problem exists between keyboard and chair). Their motivation for this was not that it enabled teams to deliver great products quickly. Their primary motivation was that it enforced certain infrastructure standards that were a part of some previously agreed approaches and it made it easy for them to respond to spending questions from finance. You could easily argue that building infrastructure to agreed standards and making accounting easier would be a part of building great products but that argument would only stand up if great products were actually being built. This pipeline problem was just one amongst many problems. Engineers were just as upset because they couldn’t agree, and no one would enforce, any language or framework standards. There was disagreement on how to move away from some out of date approaches, to newer approaches, and no agreement on what the newer approaches should be.

I had the unenviable task of trying to build new products with a recently re-organised group of these engineers.

I used numerous strategies to motivate them but one of the first strategies I put in place was Befriending a distant enemy to attack a near one. I know my way around DevOps and Infrastructure. It’s safe ground for me so I knew I could hold my own in a disagreement with the infrastructure team. I also knew that eventually I would need the Search Engine Optimisation team (SEO) and Data & Analytics on my side if my new pages were to go live with the full support of the broader organisation. I also knew that I needed to get something visual into production as soon as possible in order for the product and technology organisation to continue to enjoy the support of the rest of the business as we transformed our technology.

The distant states I needed to befriend were SEO, Data and Analytics, Marketing and the rest of the business. The neighbouring state I needed to attack was the infrastructure team.

The first page we built implemented a bunch of SEO recommendations that hadn’t been implemented in the old site. We collaborated with the Data & Analytics team on the tagging and made sure we were seen as allies. I focused all my initial efforts on the Javascript build pipeline and extended it out to deployment. This gave the engineers something to dig their teeth into early. They got busy with Lerna, YARN, NPM, Prettier, pAlly, Percy and the rest of the toolchain needed to build a first class React application pipeline.

This gave me time to work on the infrastructure team. I also took advantage of another situation. There was a desire to upgrade our Gitlab contract, the next tier up provided Gitlab-ci a modern pipeline that the developers were actually keen to work with. I worked with the infrastructure team to get the upgrade through and as soon as it was I had the engineers start work on building Gitlab pipelines and publishing a page as soon as possible.

I attacked the infrastructure team and won because I got a new pipeline, using new technology that the engineers wanted to work with and I brought everyone else on-side because they could see new pages that gave them hope that we were making real progress.

I’m sure this was seen as something of a betrayal by the infrastructure team but the results were apparent almost immediately. All of a sudden the engineers owned the pipeline, they fixed it when it broke, they optimised it when it was slow and I made sure that when it came to building the infrastructure for deployment it followed the infrastructure team’s requirements to the letter so even though we didn’t use their methods we did ensure that we didn’t compromise the outcomes they needed.

## Replace the beams with rotten timbers (偷梁換柱, Tōu liáng huàn zhù)

>Disrupt the enemy's formations, interfere with their methods of operations, and change the rules that they are used to following. In this way the supporting pillar, the common link that makes a group of men an effective fighting force, is removed.

In technology the supporting pillar is usually some status quo system that is no longer delivering the required results, or more likely these days it’s the previous attempt to replace an ageing system that wasn't fully developed.

There are two ways to attack the status quo and you need to read the situation in order to choose which one to use. You either point out its obvious benefits and claim you will evolve it or you point out its flaws and attack it on every front simultaneously.

The DWP wanted to adopt DevOps and public cloud. My team was to build the cloud infrastructure, continuous deployment pipelines and implement tests for the most basic standards. The initial instruction we were given was that all deployments into the production environment would require us to raise a ticket with a central IT organisation who would then make the changes we requested. We knew this wasn’t going to work, this was exactly the type of model our leadership wanted us to help the DWP move away from. We intended to be deploying multiple times per day just while we got our infrastructure configuration right and more importantly we wanted to be able to make rapid changes in succession as we tuned and optimised our code. We explained that we would build a script to automatically raise a ticket every time we merged our changes into the codebase and required a deployment. We demonstrated that given the size of the team and how we worked we would be raising about 40 tickets a week on just the core infrastructure code. We didn’t actually need to build the script, it was enough to demonstrate the obvious weaknesses in the current processes in order to replace them. We would have built the script though.

## Make the host and the guest exchange roles (反客為主, Fǎn kè wéi zhǔ)

>Usurp leadership in a situation where one is normally subordinate. Infiltrate one's target. Initially, pretend to be a guest to be accepted, but develop from inside and become the owner later.

This is the strategy to use when a small group is attempting to bring change to a larger organisation.

The consultant strategist is always in a subordinate position. No matter how expensive they are, the consultant is never given authority in a situation. Even when not doing so risks the entire initiative the permanent employees always have a stronger position, even if that authority just comes from their ability to escalate their concerns to human resources. A new permanent strategist often lacks authority simply by being new to the organisation and lacking domain knowledge and the history of what’s been tried before and why it didn’t work.

This book exists because when I read this strategy I had two thoughts simultaneously. One was that if I could arm a permanent employee who is frustrated by their inability to bring change into an organisation they could be much more effective than any external consultant or new person coming into their organisation. The second thought was that this book could provide a lot of consultants or new employees with some support as they entered into an organisation and tried to apply influence most effectively.

There are a few techniques I’ve developed for becoming the host when I start as the guest. The first thing I do is find some common ground where I can fully support the host. Usually I am asked to implement DevOps ways of working and taking full advantage of new technologies and the approaches associated with them such as serverless computing. It’s easy for me to ally with my hosts on these as I have seen, first-hand, the benefits that arise from both of these approaches.

Having established myself as an ally I can then offer my support to any related initiatives that are struggling. In this way I can become the borrowed knife to people within the organisation. Along with doing this I provide a useful bridge for leadership who are not as in-touch with the latest technology by being able to talk about new approaches in terms they are familiar with. In order to do this it’s useful to learn what technologies they are familiar with and subtly walk them through the changes that have occurred since then. This bridging role turns the organisation’s leadership team into a powerful distant ally. Being this bridge has two advantages for the new strategist, the first is that the strategist becomes a trusted peer and confidant of the leadership team and can help them steer the direction of the strategy giving the strategist some influence over their destiny. The other advantage is that they can use this relationship to share any difficulties they are having with individuals in the teams and they can boost the most useful individuals. When insight into leadership thinking is shared with engineers giving them greater context for their work the engineers will repay this insight with trust. The engineers can see when action is taking to improve difficult team members and when good people are recognised in public, particularly if this leads to promotion this then starts to convert the strategist into the host instead of the guest.

At Zoopla I was forced to move very quickly. I didn't have time to get to know the people or organisation problems before I had to establish new teams with new missions and get them working. As and when I could I would find out who had good institutional knowledge so I could find out what had been tried before, what had worked, what had failed and attempt to understand the root cases for the current state Zoopla was in. These discussions would often offer up insights into who was good and who had good ideas but had struggled to get them taken seriously or make progress with them. That led to a second round of meetings where I specifically looked for enthusiastic collaborators and good ideas or even solutions I could make use of. This let me have conversations with my contacts in the leadership team to find out what they thought of these people, ideas and solutions. I could share my opinions and get some conversation going. That naturally put me in a position to amplify good people, ideas and solutions and ask for help with people I was struggling with. These conversations also gave me the opportunity to share insights into what we were building. I could drop tidbits of information about the results we were achieving in the new initiative, which they could use with their peers and show they were close to the work. Doing this reasonably regularly eventually got me invited into the inner circle where I could play a role in helping the leadership with their strategic thinking and planning.

## The empty fort strategy (空城計, Kōng chéng jì)

>When the enemy has stronger forces and one expects to be overrun at any moment, act calmly and taunt the enemy, so that the enemy thinks they are walking into an ambush. This stratagem is only successful if in most cases one has a powerful hidden force...

The strategist must act calm and casual regardless of how desperate they are to bring about change. Without necessarily wishing to, people will oppose change at every turn. While acknowledging that an organisation faces an existential threat, its people will inevitably provide numerous reasons why any change proposed is a mistake. The more passionate the agents of change become the more attack vectors appear. People complain that: “The change agents aren’t collaborative, they don’t understand the domain, they’re not suggesting anything new, what’s being suggested won’t deliver measurable benefits” The Empty Fort strategy plays on what seems to be a natural human propensity to mistake confidence for competence. The strategist must act as though they don’t care whether the organisation changes or not. This removes firewood from under the pot of those who feel they have the most to lose from any change.

Probably the most extreme example of this was my first few months at Just Eat. Just Eat’s Leadership were desperate to improve reliability, millions of pounds of revenue was being lost each month. The teams who owned the individual microservices that made up the platform were working to bring gradual improvements to their individual services but there was no holistic approach aimed at improving the platform as a whole. The teams were so committed to their approach that they were very resistant to any new suggestions, even ones that would appear obvious anywhere else. I was tasked with helping teams identify opportunities to improve reliability that needed to span the whole platform, not just those ones that could be implemented by a team on their own. Even though leadership was desperate and I wanted to deliver some quick results to prove my worth I had to be very casual and friendly with my suggestions. When there was an opportunity to make search more resilient by providing a pre-generated static version of search I had to work on multiple fronts simultaneously. I had to be very sympathetic with the team themselves. They were feeling very exposed as their service was the root cause of the last two serious outages. This meant I really needed to help them come up with a solution as opposed to imposing one on them. When we came up with a solution I had to support them in their interactions with other teams. Prior to this point every team just used each other’s APIs as they saw fit. In this case the Search team needed to provide other services with a client so that Search team could control when the pre-generated version was used. This also meant the old method of calling the Search API needed to be deprecated. In addition to this I had to help the product manager explain to their leadership that the Search team’s previous Key Performance Indicator (KPI) which was the percentage of bad orders wasn’t as important as being able to place an order at all.

A bad order at Just Eat meant orders that the customer thought they could make the restaurant couldn’t service  couldn’t because they were closed, temporarily not taking orders or the specific menu items had been temporarily or permanently removed.

Earlier in the book I said: Strategy is based on deception. This is an example of that. This is a part of strategy I struggle with. I am passionate about technology and making engineers and customers lives better with technology. To have to fake nonchalance feels dishonest and I hate it but it is the only way.

## Let the enemy's own spy sow discord in the enemy camp (反間計, Fǎn jiàn jì)

>Undermine the enemy's ability to fight by secretly causing discord between them and their friends, allies, advisors, family, commanders, soldiers, and population. While they are preoccupied with settling internal disputes, their ability to attack or defend is compromised.

This strategy, as it stands, isn’t particularly useful to the strategist trying to bring change to a modern organisation. Organisations with significant discord can’t be successfully changed. However the opposite of this strategy is also true. If there are potential allies in an organisation then enhancing their effectiveness and helping them establish order in their domain and creating alliances between them will increase the overall effectiveness of an organisation. As order coalesces from the chaos an organisation’s confidence improves lending strength to all initiatives.

I earned an influential position at Zoopla. I supported a number of important initiatives and lent my support to good ideas that later became important initiatives. I also suppressed others that were not adding to the internal harmony of the organisation. Some of the initiatives I supported have been mentioned earlier such as supporting the approach of the data team and ensuring the SEO team were respected and valued. I did these primarily because I knew I would need their help later but also because it helped me amplify the work of good people who were bringing harmony from the chaos. More controversially I deliberately left other teams alone. The Listings team, who processed all the listing data from estate agents to get it on to Zoopla were not on the journey with the rest of us in Product and Tech. They thought they could evolve their ageing tech stack rather than invest in a more modern, cloud native approach. I wished them all success, there were not bad people on that team they just made a different bet to me. However I didn’t lend my weight to their efforts and instead over-emphasised the Search team who had to make the processed data usable and were embracing newer cloud-native approaches.

This provides us with another general lesson about how we can use military strategies for business purposes. Strategies that the military uses to disrupt their enemies can be reversed to look at how support can be lent to allies. Strategies that include support for allies can be used directly.

## Chain stratagems (連環計, Lián huán jì)

>In important matters, one should use several stratagems applied simultaneously after another as in a chain of stratagems. Keep different plans operating in an overall scheme; if any one strategy fails, apply the next strategy.

Strategies should be thought of like an information flow diagram. Where a function is applied to transform some data a strategy is a pattern that can be applied to a situation to achieve a result. For any significant problem multiple strategies should be used together just as multiple functions can be used, some in different circumstances as the situation develops and unexpected challenges or opportunities present themselves.

## Conclusion

The strategies listed in this chapter are some of the most ancient recorded and yet all of them can have modern applications with a little thought.

The strategists enemies are the problems that need to be solved.
The terrain the strategist operates on is knowledge, intellectual positions, opinion and feelings.
