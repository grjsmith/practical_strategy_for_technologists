# Chapter 5: Ancient strategies

This chapter will introduce some very simple tactics that were the mainstay of military commanders in ancient China. These can seem overly simple in a modern business context but they are the foundations upon which more complex strategies are built. A modern strategy might involve several of these tactics operating in series or in parallel. The tactics are presented individually here with  examples where they have been used them successfully.

These were all chosen from the Thirty-Six Stratagems (Search Wikipedia for: Thirty-Six Stratagems).

## Remove the ladder when the enemy has ascended to the roof (上屋抽梯, Shàng wū chōu tī)

>With baits and deceptions, lure the enemy into treacherous terrain and cut off their lines of communication and escape routes. To save themselves, they must fight both one's own forces and the elements of nature.

Whenever you see terrain or a physical environment described in military tactics replace the word terrain with the idea of an intellectual position, or a previously agreed upon approach, or strongly held opinion or mindset. This is the terrain of knowledge workers, this is why empathy is so powerful, it gives the strategist insight into the terrain other people are operating on.

Treacherous terrain equates to ideas that someone struggles to get around. An example of this is the developer who is adamant that a particular programming language is the only possible option even though the organization can’t hire developers with skills and experience in that language. The developer has a strong position, it can’t be attacked directly because they are so emotionally invested in it but the position has a clear weakness in that the organization can’t grow it’s development capability in that language. At some point that developer will see that their position is weak. They won’t necessarily change their mind, some people struggle to do that even in the face of overwhelming evidence but the position has now changed to a performance management issue as opposed to a conflict of ideas.

This idea doesn’t just pertain to people, it also works with any immobile position. When the people, software or services that  oppose the tactics have a strongly held position then the tactician should counter it with an equally strong opinion but one that is weakly held. The tactician should be open to hearing how their idea won’t work and should feel empowered to question those who disagree with the idea. As long as we actually listen to the opposing positions and we don’t just spend time thinking of what to say next. In this way the opposition maneuvers themselves into a position where they have nowhere to go. That might not grant an immediate victory but over time people will begin to see the weaknesses in the opposing position.

This strategy specifically talks about attacking the enemy, in all the strategies that follow replace the word enemy with problem. As discussed previously, in modern business it’s very rare we have a defined enemy that we might attack in the way the military does but we definitely have problems that we want to overcome.

## Make a sound in the east, then strike in the west (聲東擊西, Shēng dōng jī xī)

>In any battle the element of surprise can provide an overwhelming advantage. Even when face-to-face with an enemy, surprise can still be employed by attacking where they least expect it. Create an expectation in the enemy's mind through the use of a feint. Manipulate the enemy to focus their resources somewhere before attacking elsewhere that is poorly defended. Tactically, this is known as an "open feint".

In some respects this tactic describes the importance of having a tactical approach. If the problem being tackled is defined well enough the edges of the problem will become clear and that will indicate the best place to start tackling it. That doesn’t mean that problems should always be tackled at the edges. If there are few edges that might be the right answer, if there are many edges sometimes it pays to start in the middle. Equally not all edges are created equal, a specific strength or weakness might also provide a useful guide. Complex problems that are made up of elements of people, process and technology will have several fronts and attempting to just solve one problem at a time will likely cause the problem to mutate. A good example of this is found in many product transformation initiatives. Many businesses are waking up to the power of product management. Somebody in the organization wants to move away from being project led and move to being product led. This is a problem with many fronts and if tackled in just one place the problem will mutate.

One of the problems faced by project based organizations is that value is often poorly understood. Usually value is only understood as direct sales and so it’s very difficult to get funding for initiatives that don’t lead to directly easily attributed revenue growth. This makes it difficult to justify unproven experiments. This can lead people to think that there is a chicken and egg problem. To prove that experimentation can lead to increased sales requires funding to acquire an experimentation capability and the developers to build it into the product. That’s a deadlocked position and tackling any one end of that problem just causes the problem to get more difficult.

In order to be successful either a sponsor with enough political power is needed to break the deadlock or both problems need to be tackled simultaneously. The finance organization and the c-suite that empower it need to be educated with a more nuanced understanding of value, that can make way for outcome based budgeting rather than project based budgeting. Simultaneously the power of experimentation needs to be demonstrated to the organization. Experimentation doesn’t require an experimentation tool, particularly if the experiment is a proof-of-concept designed to demonstrate the value of experimentation.

If the finance problem is tackled head-on months of effort will be expended for no measurable gain and momentum will be lost. If the experimentation problem is tackled head-on time and people will be spent against an ever increasing problem space as more and more demands are made.

By defining several tactical objectives the strategist can choose where to expend their effort and that of their teams on an hour-by-hour basis based on where the greatest advantages present themselves and the successes can be used as distractions for the next actions and momentum can be built which will improve the morale of the organization which in turn makes success more likely.

This is a strategy that works well with other strategies such as a borrowed knife and partner with an ally with both of you using the other's successes to buy time, build morale, demonstrate value and provide cover.

At Zoopla merely having a tactical approach put me at an advantage. I could use it to keep the staff motivated, I could use it to identify two way doors, and opportunities, I could use it to reassure my leadership when they were nervous about making a decision. When I was frustrated by challenges on one front I could turn my focus to one of my other objectives and make progress there. This was possible because I had tactics and I could accept friction in one area and even allow some smaller problems to work themselves out while I tackled problems elsewhere.

## Deceive the heavens to cross the sea (瞞天過海, Mán tiān guò hǎi)

>Mask one's real goals from those in authority who lack vision by not alerting them to one's movements or any part of one's plan.

This is a cautionary tale about moving too quickly. Sometimes time can be used as an ally. If we have defined a tactical approach and we are tackling problems on multiple fronts then we can choose when to tackle each aspect of each problem. When an organization decides to change something about itself like a product transformation or a digital transformation there will be people who have an emotional attachment to the current way of working or a general negative disposition to change. Neither of these positions are necessarily unreasonable. I don’t say that to be diplomatic, it’s true, the people who have seen changes fail have useful experience that we should learn from. However these positions apply a friction against the change the organization wants to make and so they need to be resolved. Moving quickly and attempting to resolve these issues head-on is more likely to cause these people to feel cornered and react more emotionally, not less. Taking a calm approach and listening, while making small cautious changes that take some of these people’s concerns into account will be more productive than a series of emotional debates. If necessary these moves can be distractions and false fronts while momentum is built for a bigger push. The sunk cost fallacy can be used to the our advantage here.

A great way to do this is for the strategist and tactician to hide their intent behind an alternative motive. If the challenge is to orchestrate a reorganization, the they should take on a functional roles inside the organization. They should learn first-hand what the problems are. They should decide for themselves if the re-organization will really solve the problems that are perceived to exist. Too many reorganizations are perceived as unnecessary because people in the teams don’t see the problems the leadership see. By operating inside an organization the strategist and tactician will learn the language of the organization. If that experience leads them to conclude that a reorganization is needed they can even start the change management and communications activities while they are still operating inside the organization.

If you’re reading this and you think this is duplicitous and dishonest then consider that it would be impossible to fully empathize with the people in the teams as an outsider.

## Besiege Wèi to rescue Zhào (圍魏救趙, Wéi Wèi jiù Zhào)

>When the enemy is too strong to be attacked directly, attack something they cherish. The idea is to avoid a head-on battle with a strong enemy, and instead strike at their weakness elsewhere. This will force the strong enemy to retreat in order to support their weakness. Battling against a tired and dispirited enemy will give a much higher chance of success.

In the military context this tactic is presented in it suggests that When attempting to achieve something ambitious it's worth considering setting up some alternative objectives to draw attention away from the main goal.

This is very helpful in a modern business context too. Not because we’re trying to fool people  but because there might be multiple routes we can use to achieve our objective and we don’t want to plan ourselves into a corner. Instead we want to retain the flexibility of multiple tactical approaches.

Marketing, finance, customer service functions and the technology leaders that need to manage expectations with these stakeholders are uncomfortable with the level of ambiguity we live with in technology. No matter how many times people attempt to create analogies where they equate software engineering with assembly line manufacturing or the building industry it isn’t like either of those industries. As much as we try to rely on open standards, open source, software and platform-as-a-service offerings there is still an aspect of bespoke, artisanal code that is subject to ambiguity. We need room to find our way to answers while appearing like we’re working to a fully worked out plan.

The goal of the tactician, in a technology organization, should be to establish multiple routes to success and structure the implementation such that it can quickly switch between these routes. This gives the flexibility needed to achieve success and allows the tactician to be able to give ground pragmatically without sacrificing anything meaningful. Many initiatives have been sabotaged because a single change to the approach is deemed as evidence of a failure or poor management. This approach provides a defense against these claims.

This is a practical reason to ensure a system architecture has some form of anti-corruption layer. Be that an API Gateway, Super Graph or even just an easily manageable routing layer that gives control over web and mobile traffic. This gives the flexibility needed to ensure that if one approach doesn’t work out it can be changed in isolation without impacting all the other teams involved.

## Kill with a borrowed knife (借刀殺人, Jiè dāo shā rén)

>Attack using the strength of another when in a situation where using one's own strength is not favorable. For example, trick an ally into attacking them or use the enemy's own strength against them. The idea is to cause damage to the enemy via a third party.

Sometimes the right thing to do is to forge alliances and sometimes the right thing to do is to use others strengths without them being aware of it. In a strictly technological context we do this all the time, this is why we use open source software, when we do this we forge an alliance with a bunch of skilled and committed engineers we don’t even know. Inside an organization the tactician should always look for people who share their goals and values. More can be achieved as teams than can be achieved as individuals; this becomes a tactic when the tactician chooses to tie the success of their initiative to that of other teams and organizations.

Before the tactician identifies their tactics they need to take stock of the resources and people available to them. Where there are obvious weaknesses it first needs to be determined if these weaknesses can be fortified. If not it needs to be seen if the weakness can be transmuted into a strength and finally if neither of those are possible the tactician needs to find strength from elsewhere.

Search Engine Optimization teams (SEO) make great allies when building web services, they’re sometimes seen as a necessary evil by technology teams because they are often more closely aligned to marketing. Business Intelligence and Analytics functions make useful allies particularly if the tactician is implementing some sort of centralized event system. Event systems are great places for BI and Analytics teams to harvest real-time operational data. Product Marketing teams are powerful allies that the strategist can benefit from in the run up to a launch event. Product Marketing knows everyone and they can make a powerful ally in a steering committee. In all of these cases the tactician has something they can offer to these allies in return for their support. To SEO the strategist building web services can encapsulate all of the functional SEO requirements in the new build where they take up very little additional time. To BI teams the strategist can offer access to real-time raw data with auditable provenance. To Product Marketing the strategist is a source of truth about what is coming and when.

## Wait at leisure while the enemy labors (以逸待勞, Yǐ yì dài láo)

>It is advantageous to choose the time and place for battle while the enemy does not. Encourage the enemy to expend their energy in futile quests while one conserves their strength. When the enemy is exhausted and confused, attack with energy and purpose.

Most of the problems we need to solve are large and complicated and involve people, politics, culture, technology and processes. These aren’t the sort of problems that can be tackled head-on or all at once. Cunning tacticians look for the problems that will take the longest to resolve and, if possible, start with them, then they look for opportunities to tackle the other problems along the way. Culture, politics and people usually take the longest to change so it’s often a good idea to choose tactics for these first even if the primary goal is to introduce some functional change. This is where the tactician chooses their battlefields. This strategy is most effective when the people who need to change don’t have formally defined tactics of their own.

When designing the tactics we start by imaging what the end result will look like to the various stakeholders within the organization. This is where the essays we wrote at school will be useful. Imaging what it would be like to be a peasant in the middle ages or imagining what it would be like to be a soldier in the trenches in the first world war was good training for imaging what life will be like for a software engineer, a director of technology or a product marketer in the organization after the changes have been made.

Designing this end result allows the strategist to work backwards through the delta between this future world and the current one. Will engineers deploy whenever their tests have passed? If so, what stops them from doing that now? Is it just the lack of the appropriate tools or is there a command and control function blocking deploys? Are there compliance and governance teams demanding manual checks? Are the teams taking accountability for the performance and reliability of the software they build?

Working through questions helps define all the problems that the approach needs to solve. If any of these problems are created by the way people think about problems or fear, uncertainty and doubt the tactics must start addressing these as quickly as possible. The best way to deliver transformation is through delivery. If an organization is embarking on a public cloud for the first time, deliver a system architecture diagram and engage the security team in a threat modelling exercise early. If an organization is using some new software they haven’t used before, get it into production as soon as possible, even if it’s just doing something trivial. Regularly report on its successes. This all might seem like a technical exercise but it isn’t, it’s a cultural and human change management exercise. People are most afraid and uncertain about what they don’t understand. The tactician should look for as many early proofs of their approach as they can. People’s natural adaptability will do the rest. Within a couple of weeks what was once frightening will become commonplace.

## Loot a burning house (趁火打劫, Chèn huǒ dǎ jié)

>When a country is beset by internal problems, such as disease, famine, corruption, and crime, it is poorly-equipped to deal with an outside threat. Keep gathering internal information about an enemy. If the enemy is in its weakest state, attack them without mercy and annihilate them to prevent future troubles.

When a team is embattled and struggling that's when they are most susceptible to being helped.

Sometimes the biggest barrier to change is the teams within an organization who have decided that they have no reason to change. There are any number of reasons why they have decided they don’t need to change. Maybe they think they’ve seen all this before and didn’t need change then and don’t need it now. Perhaps there was a recent re-organization that didn’t fundamentally change anything and so they have decided that all change is pointless. It may be that they have seen other teams go through a similar change and they don’t perceive any material difference.

The challenge in these situations is to help then realize how much pain they are in.

Humans are very adaptable and will normalize bad situations. Sometimes all that’s needed is to show people that their lives can be better with some changes. This can be done in a few different ways. The tactician can work alongside them and point out some of the problems in the hope that the people in the team see that those things are problems and they’ll engage with trying to design solutions. Another approach is to put them in pain and offer the solution. Teams in modern organizations are usually one part of a greater whole where their function is dependent on upstream functions and has commitments to downstream functions. If a team is sticking to their guns that they don’t need change then the strategist can focus on the teams around them. Helping the upstream and downstream teams offer a wider range of capabilities and improved performance to their stakeholders. This will put pressure on the recalcitrant teams to adapt to those new capabilities. This can force the need for change even on the most stubborn teams.

## Openly repair the gallery roads, but sneak through the passage of Chencang (明修棧道，暗渡陳倉, Míng xiū zhàn dào, àn dù Chéncāng)

>Deceive the enemy with an obvious approach that will take a very long time, while ambushing them with another approach. It is an extension of the "Make a sound in the east, then strike in the west" tactic, but instead of merely spreading misinformation to draw the enemy's attention, physical decoys are used to further misdirect the enemy. The decoys must be easily seen by the enemy to draw their attention while acting as if they are meant to do what they are falsely doing to avoid suspicion.

This tactic contains two lessons for new tacticians. Solving problems requires the careful management of information and a wealth of opportunities become available if the the tension between solving problems directly and indirectly can be managed.

I have numerous examples of organizations who have chosen to invest in a new technology approach and full of enthusiasm they start talking excitedly about how wonderful the new world will be without giving a thought to how dismissed and spurned the people who have worked hard on the current tech stack will feel. The most mobile of those people will move on and those left behind will become embittered and will adopt a siege mentality. This isn’t healthy for them or for the organization. They can cause significant disruption to the new approach without even meaning to.

Transformation seems to be an essential part of business. There are businesses who manage to maintain a steady rate of change and investment but in my experience it’s far more common for businesses to transition between investment and exploitation phases. These investment phases are often transformations as organizations adopt cloud or software-as-a-service approaches, or newer languages and frameworks or new approaches to getting insight from data.

While it might be a desired goal that old approaches be entirely swept away by a wave of new technology more often than not the actual result is that the new technology delivers the required results and the work is not done to migrate and close down those older solutions that just continue to work. It’s important that those people who know the older tech stacks are valued and treated with respect. As such the way transformation is talked about needs to be managed. It is important that business stakeholders and investors have hope and confidence in a brighter future with more flexibility but it’s just as important that the present reality is faced. Too often the technology that generates all the revenue is known as legacy. The way transformation is discussed needs to be carefully managed. The message to the technology team should be one of hope and investment in new approaches. that will deliver different capabilities and different results. The message should be paired with another message that the older technology, that still underpins parts of the business, will be managed and optimized for their new role in which they don’t receive the lion’s share of the development effort.

A number of tactics can be employed to enact this strategy in the context of a business transformation:

We should recognize that the existing tech is probably not going to be replaced in any foreseeable timescale. It needs to be optimized for its new role as do the teams who will maintain it. This first requires an optimization and then a shift to a maintenance mode. As this technology stack is no longer going to be the primary focus of engineering it needs to be easy to maintain. There are a number of ways to do this while also enabling the shift to a new technology stack. It’s likely the old technology stack has poor test coverage and only a rudimentary build and deploy pipeline. Now is the time for making small changes with short bursts of effort and using processes and standard operating procedures to reduce the effort required to maintain the old technology.

Ensure the team supporting the existing technology feels important and valued. They are but it’s easy during the excitement of preparing for a transformation to make those teams feel undervalued and ignored. The way to do this is to make them consultants for the transformation. They are experts in the business domain and have a wealth of experience of the unique difficulties faced when building technology in this business. The new technology being built will likely rely on some elements of the old stack, at the very least it probably needs the data from it, even if it doesn’t want to use the old data stores. The team most familiar with the existing technology stack and its data are best placed to help build whatever solutions are needed to ensure both technologies can work side-by-side. My preferred approach to this is to modify the code that writes to the old data stores to also create events on topics in an event/log streaming solution like EventBridge or Kafka.

Ensure the teams who are going to maintain the existing tech are kept busy. They should start by codifying standard operating procedures. A handful of important end to end tests should be added. The maintenance team should provide consultancy to the new initiative reviewing the new technology approaches. Where people in the maintenance team are keen they should be trained on the new technology stack and if time allows should temporarily join the teams building the new technology so they can put their training into practice.

## Watch the fires burning across the river (隔岸觀火, Gé àn guān huǒ)

>Delay entering the field of battle until all other parties become exhausted by fighting amongst each other. Go in at full strength and finish them off.

In the largest organizations it’s quite common to find multiple teams whose remits overlap. There’s often some confusion about exactly what architects do in an organization that also has principal engineers. Security, audit, compliance and data governance teams will often coexist and there often aren’t clear distinctions defining where one team’s accountability stops and another starts. In worst case scenarios these teams might claim no accountability at all and that their role is that of critic rather than contributor.

The tactician should always expect to engage with these teams but a cunning tactician will choose when and where that engagement should take place. It’s always wise to meet these teams early and develop a familiarity with them. We should aim to learn these team’s pain points and understand what they think the organization's problems are. If these team’s goals align closely with those of the transformation then the tactician will have some powerful allies if they manage the relationships well. If these teams goals do not align with those of the leadership's transformation goals then we need to make that disconnect visible without looking like we are attacking the people in these teams.

Someone new to tactics, change programmes or transformation may not recognize this for the problem it is. They might assume that if some teams aren’t aligned to the leadership’s vision then escalation will solve the problem. The root cause of this lack of alignment is often because the technology leadership don’t have experience of dealing with these sorts of teams and might consider them as a necessary function that takes place after the software has been built or might just ignore them until an application has to go live. In organizations like this the entire burden for satisfying the architecture, security, audit, compliance and governance teams falls on a product delivery team who thought their job was just to write some software. This is a frustrating and painful situation that frustrates all parties. The people in the middle of this situation are not in the best place to resolve it. The architecture, audit, governance, security and compliance teams will often resort to saying that they should be engaged earlier in the software development lifecycle. What that doesn’t address is helping a product delivery team understand how to get the most value out of these teams.

Watching the fires burning across the river suggests that one way to solve this problem is to engage these teams early. Having engaged the teams the tactician should be looking to distill clear, testable requirements from these teams. We are trying to build an automated test capability that provides constant auditable assurance that regulations and compliance requirements are being met each time software is built and released. In order to do this we explain that these teams need to work together to create the requirements to inform these automated tests. That creates the space required for the next phase of the delivery. As requirements come out from this group of teams they can be added to an appropriate pipeline stage. If the teams push back because their role is to review and criticize implementations as opposed to leading on the requirements necessary to comply with regulations and satisfy audits that is the time to escalate. No leadership team wants to hear that teams exist merely to offer consultancy to other teams.

## Hide a knife behind a smile (笑裏藏刀, Xiào lǐ cáng dāo)

>Charm and ingratiate oneself with the enemy. When their trust is gained, move against them in secret.

This is a simple parable about guarding the true vision carefully. Sometimes a leadership team needs to achieve a result but its people aren’t able to conceive of the steps needed to get there. Attacking sacred ideals head-on won't achieve anything. Smiling and accepting the difficulties that can't be surmounted yet allows the tactician the space and time to enact their tactics.

In order to successfully communicate something an audience has to be capable of receiving and engaging with the message as well as the message being crafted for that audience. This means that communicating a vision or a strategy in its entirety might not be possible and worse it could backfire and cause the initiative to fail before it’s even begun. This is particularly true in an organization where the people are suffering, have undergone significant upheaval or have been trying to transform and reinvent themselves and failing. People in this state are in no position to hear about another grand vision. They can consider a small number of immediately practical activities that will resolve some of their immediate pain points or concerns. Once the team is through that process they can hear a little more, such as how the changes that have just been successfully delivered (and celebrated) will be leveraged for a new small initiative. With that safely underway and the team energized by recent successes they might be in a position to hear about the next goal. It isn’t until the team has gained a measure of self-confidence born from seeing the real-world impact of their recent successes that they can be in a position to think about strategy.

In this tactic our enemy is still a problem, it isn't the people in the organization. The enemy is the psychological safety of our people.

## Sacrifice the plum tree to preserve the peach tree (李代桃僵, Lǐ dài táo jiāng)

>There are circumstances where short-term objectives must be sacrificed in order to gain the long-term goal. This is the scapegoat strategy where someone suffers the consequences so that the rest do not.

When designing tactics we must ensure there is sufficient flexibility to allow it to continue to make progress towards the required outcomes even if it suffers setbacks. A tactical approach that offers no flexibility will fail at the first crisis.

The master tactician will create an approach that contains acceptable sacrifices built in that still allows the most important outcomes to be achieved. This does not mean that the approach should contain unnecessary outcomes. They would be easily seen through and render the tactician untrustworthy. Nor does this mean adding fat to the plan so headcount could be easily cut, that is also easily seen through and other departments will already be doing that. Instead scope the outcomes such that solutions ranging from ideal to good enough are possible. The tactical approach must be able to continue successfully regardless of which implementation is chosen at each stage. In technical terms each tactical approach within the strategy should be only loosely coupled to the other tactics. That way if it’s necessary to compromise one or more tactical approaches it isn’t necessary to change the whole strategy. Take careful note of that word scope. Don’t plan all those approaches; define a tactical approach that you know will give you flexibility in multiple places when it’s time to implement the solution or modify the approach.

## Take the opportunity to pilfer a goat (順手牽羊, Shùn shǒu qiān yáng)

>While carrying out one's plans, be flexible enough to take advantage of any opportunity that presents itself, however small, and avail oneself of any profit, however slight.

In sacrificing the plum tree to preserve the peach tree we design our tactics to be resilient to undesirable changes. In being prepared to pilfer a goat we design our tactics such that opportunities can be taken advantage of.

This tactic and the previous one highlight the importance of having a tactical approach. Plans alone are seldom resilient enough to withstand the trials and tribulations that occur in a large organization over a significant period of time. However a well developed tactical approach supported by several loosely coupled plans can withstand an enormous amount of change and still ensure teams remain headed in the right direction.

One of the problems Zoopla’s technology department faced back in 2018 is one faced by many organizations. They had drawn a line between network infrastructure and software engineering and designed their solutions accordingly and the industry had moved on and that line was now in the wrong place.

Zoopla's tech stack used a network traffic routing solution that was managed by the infrastructure team because it relied on a language and operating paradigm that was unfamiliar to the software engineering teams. This was a relatively small problem but compounded with a bunch of other relatively small problems it created a perception of blocking teams.

Part of the outcome we were trying to achieve was to empower the software engineers to build, test and launch their products without needing to ask permission of anyone. The idea was that the teams building apps were entirely accountable for the performance and availability of those apps.

It was becoming obvious that the way I wanted to do this wouldn’t work because we weren’t going to be allowed to migrate all the web pages to the new application framework. I was in the process of figuring out how to work around this when my hand got forced.

One of the team members committed us to replacing the site header across all the different web technology stacks to show support for Pride month. Something that would have required manual work across an uncertain number of pages on three different web technologies. Something we had been trying to avoid by moving everything to one solution. Now with a fixed deadline and my ideal solution impossible we needed to find another way.

After a short discussion we choose to use an old approach called Server Side Injection (SSI). The very network traffic routing solution that allowed these three web technologies to work together at all could also inject a new header and footer on to each page. We could build that new header and footer in the technology we wanted to use. Further we could deploy it using our chosen pipeline. The solution was a little clunky but it worked.

Facing all the constraints and solving the problem had a number of positive knock-on effects. Our project to improve the technology got a huge boost across the business as people saw us do something that had proven impossible before. In embracing the old routing solution and showing that we could work with it using the technologies that we wanted to use we identified further opportunities to use it to great effect.

## Stomp the grass to scare the snake (打草驚蛇, Dǎ cǎo jīng shé)

>Do something unaimed, but spectacular ("hitting the grass") to provoke a response from the enemy ("startle the snake") to have them give away their plans or position. Do something unusual, strange, and unexpected to arouse the enemy's suspicion and disrupt their thinking.

The tactician doesn’t always have to be the one to stomp the grass. We must pay close attention to all the situations around the business. We should study the impacts of changes in different places to learn who might be an ally and who might be an adversary. We remember Sun Tsu’s advice about the general who makes many calculations.

It isn't always easy to know how people will react to a tactic. It's worth forming sallies using smaller and less ambitious goals to determine who our allies might be and who our adversaries are and what their responses might be. Use stories to test out ideas. I use statements like “in other companies in similar situations I’ve seen this approach work” this allows someone to support the idea or tell me when that was tried and why it didn’t work. Either way I’ve learned something useful.

Architecture patterns are useful for this. At Zoopla the processing of listings data from estate agents is the core of the business. When I was there it  was also the oldest part of the technology stack. The paradigms being used to process the data were very old. When solving that problem today no one would build what was there. Once I understood what it was doing and how it worked it seemed obvious to suggest that the team investigate an event-driven architecture for processing this data. I would have loved to have the team embrace the idea with gusto and get on with it, it would have made later challenges easier. While some of the team embraced the idea and others were cautious the idea was rejected by the leader of that team and the leadership made no moves to support the idea either. While I was disappointed I learned a lot about what sort of ideas Zoopla would back and what they wouldn’t. This allowed me to reshape my approach to achieve the outcomes I needed to achieve.

Tactics connected by Loosely-coupled plans linked to an overall strategy allowed me to be successful even though the Listings team were the snake I startled in the grass. This was the event that cemented, in my mind, the way I would suggest or propose approaches from this point forward. Even though I couldn’t modernize Listing processing I was able to modernize Search, which is the place where those listings start being valuable. The Search team could make requests of the Listings team to make small changes to make Search more effective which still allowed the overall programme and the strategy to be successful even if I didn’t get everything all my own way.

## Borrow a corpse to resurrect the soul (借屍還魂, Jiè shī huán hún)

>Take an institution, a technology, a method, or even an ideology that has been forgotten or discarded and appropriate it for one's own purposes.

In an organization struggling under the weight of years of bad decisions or lack of decisions progress can’t be made by joining the throng of people complaining. Every solution suggested will have been tried before. It doesn't matter that the solution was tackled in a different context or by different people or with different technology there will always be naysayers who will argue with any proposal and no evidence will persuade them.

A better strategy is to find something to praise about the old implementation. Something good that brings people on-side so they can be probed for helpful suggestions they might support or finding something that can form part of a new approach.

At Just Eat, back in 2016, there were significant reliability problems in part caused by core parts of the service relying on a central relational database which had been scaled as far as it practically could be.

A messaging solution had been built and partially implemented that could form the core of an event-driven architecture. Importantly the person who had the original vision for the event driven architecture and who had written some of the first parts of the messaging library was still at Just Eat. He was in a senior position and was widely respected by engineers and leaders and was expected to continue to rise. This event-driven architecture was the key to reducing the workload on the central database. The more transactions we could push into the events system the less those transactions had to hit the old central database. I didn’t need to engage in any falsehood, not only was the design of the event system good, the guy who spearheaded it was genuinely good too and a nice person to work with. All I needed to do was to point out that this was the right solution. Identify those expensive transactions that would make the most difference to database performance and then get those pieces of work on to the backlogs of the teams who owned the relevant parts of the system.

It’s a stretch to say that Just Eat’s messaging system was a corpse but it wasn’t appreciated as much as it should have been and raising its profile was significantly easier and led to faster progress than trying to introduce a new solution. It also offered me the opportunity to create a useful alliance with a powerful ally that I enjoyed working with.

## Lure the tiger down the mountain (調虎離山, Diào hǔ lí shān)

>Never directly attack an opponent whose advantage is derived from their position. Instead, lure them away from their position to separate them from their source of strength.

The status quo is an easily defensible position. The type of organization the tactician will usually find themselves in is probably generating significant revenue from it’s existing systems but is looking to introduce some change. There will be many people who see no need for change because the business is doing just fine as it is. Reaching these people is very difficult if not impossible. Rather than attempting to bring them from their position to ours the best approach is to have them voluntarily come to our position because the weakness of their position becomes obvious to them.

A great example of this strategy in action is the DevOps movement. For decades development attacked operations by pushing deadlines and blaming ops for launch delays. In return operations would attack development for not honouring deadline commitments and providing properly tested software in time. Both were entrenched positions. Developers were late because scope wasn't adequately managed and genuine unforeseeable complications. Ops were entrenched because they provided out of hours cover and managed all the esoteric systems the Developers didn't want to. This led to decades of fighting with no clear resolution.

The deadlock was broken when developers realized that the modern world required that they had to run what they built and operations realized they needed to help developers by providing tools and platforms that weren't easy for developers to provide for themselves.

This is a huge simplification of a decade long transformation across an entire industry but it is what happened. Both parties lured each other out of their entrenched positions and both parties won.

## Remove the firewood from under the pot (釜底抽薪, Fǔ dǐ chōu xīn)

>Take out the leading argument or asset of someone; "steal someone's thunder". This is the essence of the indirect approach: instead of attacking enemy's fighting forces, direct attacks against their ability to wage war. Literally, take the fuel out of the fire.

In a technology context removing firewood from under someone's pot means taking advantage off interoperability. Technology has never been more interoperable than it is right now. Choosing technologies specifically because of this interoperability is a great tactic for tackling counter-arguments to innovation.

Many companies have got themselves into a boom and bust cycle of innovation and exploitation. They campaign for years to get budget and permission to spend some of their energy on their technology, then, if they’re lucky they get 9-24 months of innovation before they are then forced to spend the next 5-6 years exploiting whatever they’ve been able to innovate in the time they were given. This is not necessary. Technology investment does not need to follow a boom and bust cycle. Nor does choosing a new technology necessarily mean stopping all feature development.

In recent years I’ve helped two organizations migrate from vanilla Javascript with Handlebars to React. React is just Javascript. React and vanilla Javascript can coexist. There’s no reason to down tools and spend months building React pages. It is perfectly possible to invest a small portion of energy and budget to introduce a new approach and then manage a gradual migration where that makes the most sense and delivers the most value.

I’ve seen the same problem in the data space. Data Mesh is a modern approach that allows building pipelines and product specific data marts to deliver targeted insight from data. It’s not necessary to spend a year building an almighty data warehouse in order to get business insights. A small team can build a data pipeline, process some data and deliver business insights in just a few weeks.

It’s no longer necessary to stop the world when it’s time to invest in technology. There can be no better success than the one no one was expecting. Implementing something small that interoperates well with the old and the new technologies removes the fuel from arguments about the cost of investing. A common problem new leaders find themselves in is that the only way forward they can see is to stop everything and build it all again from scratch or to make no significant immediate change and attempt to get some results by gradually changing the behaviors of the people involved. There is a third way, use the most modern approaches to build small, immutable systems that can be quickly launched, tested and decommissioned with almost no infrastructure costs.

In addition to this there are a lot of Platform As A Service (PAAS) offerings that can require very little in the way of code to make them work. At Marks and Spencer we tried a new approach to serving the new web site we were building by using a new platform-as-a-service offering, instead of the traditional content delivery network (CDN) doing so, reduced the infrastructure as code by nearly 3000 lines.

## Befriend a distant state and strike a neighboring one (遠交近攻, Yuǎn jiāo jìn gōng)

>Invading nations close to oneself carries a higher chance of success. The battlefields are close to one's domain and as such is easier for one's troops to receive supplies and defend the conquered land. Make allies with nations far away from oneself, as it is unwise to invade them.

When I joined Zoopla the engineers were unhappy about a great many aspects of engineering. They felt powerless to change many of these things because each thing they were unhappy with had been put in place by people who weren’t actually motivated by the same things as they were.

Motivation is a tricky thing, if you had asked anyone on the product and technology floor if their primary motivation was to deliver great products quickly they would have immediately agreed. It quickly became clear that was not necessarily the primary motivation at play in all decision making.

The infrastructure team were adamant that all the engineers use the Jenkins pipeline they provided. Any problems the engineers had deploying their applications were due to a lack of education or a lack of troubleshooting. Their motivation for this was not that it enabled teams to deliver great products quickly. Their primary motivation was that it enforced certain infrastructure standards that made it easy for them to respond to spending questions from finance. You could easily argue that building infrastructure to agreed standards and making accounting easier would be a part of building great products but that argument would only stand up if great products were actually being built. This pipeline problem was just one amongst many problems. Engineers were just as upset because they couldn’t agree, and no one would enforce, any language or framework standards. There was disagreement on how to move away from some out of date approaches, to newer approaches, and no agreement on what the newer approaches should be.

I had the unenviable task of building new products with a recently re-organized group of these engineers.

I used numerous strategies to motivate them but one of the first strategies I put in place was Befriending a distant enemy to attack a near one. I know my way around DevOps and Infrastructure. It’s safe ground for me so I knew I could hold my own in a disagreement with the infrastructure team. I also knew that eventually I would need the Search Engine Optimization team (SEO) and Data & Analytics on my side if my new pages were to go live with the full support of the rest of the organization. I also knew that I needed to get something visual into production as soon as possible in order for us to continue to enjoy the support of the rest of the business as we transformed the technology capability.

The distant states I needed to befriend were SEO, Data and Analytics, Marketing and the Senior Leadership Team. The neighboring state I could attack was the infrastructure team.

The first page we built implemented a bunch of SEO recommendations that hadn’t been implemented in the old site. We collaborated with the Data & Analytics team on the tagging and made sure we were seen as allies. I focused all my initial efforts on the Javascript build pipeline and extended it out to deployment. This gave the engineers something to dig their teeth into early. They got busy with Lerna, YARN, NPM, Prettier, pAlly, Percy and the rest of the toolchain needed to build a first class React application pipeline.

This gave me time to work on the infrastructure team. I took advantage of another situation. There was a desire to upgrade our Gitlab contract, the next tier up provided Gitlab-ci a modern pipeline that the developers were actually keen to work with. I worked with the infrastructure team to get the upgrade through and as soon as it was I had the engineers start work on building Gitlab pipelines and publishing a page as soon as possible.

I attacked the infrastructure team and won because I got a new pipeline that used new technology that the engineers actually wanted to work with. I brought everyone else on-side because they could see new pages that gave them hope that we were making real progress.

I’m sure this was seen as something of a betrayal by the infrastructure team but the results were apparent almost immediately. All of a sudden the engineers owned the pipeline, they fixed it when it broke, they optimized it when it was slow. I made sure that when it came to building the infrastructure for deployment it followed the infrastructure team’s requirements to the letter. Even though we didn’t use their methods we did ensure that we didn’t compromise their, or the finance team's outcomes.

## Replace the beams with rotten timbers (偷梁換柱, Tōu liáng huàn zhù)

>Disrupt the enemy's formations, interfere with their methods of operations, and change the rules that they are used to following. In this way the supporting pillar, the common link that makes a group of men an effective fighting force, is removed.

In technology the supporting pillar is usually some status quo system that is no longer delivering the required results, or more likely these days it’s the previous attempt to replace an ageing system that wasn't fully developed.

There are two ways to attack the status quo and you need to read the situation in order to choose which one to use. You either point out its obvious benefits and claim you will evolve it or you point out its flaws and attack it on every front simultaneously.

The DWP wanted to adopt DevOps and public cloud. My team was to build the cloud infrastructure, continuous deployment pipelines and implement tests for the most basic standards. The initial instruction we were given was that all deployments into the production environment would require us to raise a ticket with a central IT organization who would then make the changes we requested. We knew this wasn’t going to work, this was exactly the type of model our leadership wanted us to help the DWP move away from. We intended to be deploying multiple times per day just while we got our infrastructure configuration right and more importantly we wanted to be able to make rapid changes in succession as we tuned and optimized our code. We explained that we would build a script to automatically raise a ticket every time we merged our changes into the codebase and required a deployment. We demonstrated that given the size of the team and how we worked we would be raising about 40 tickets a week on just the core infrastructure code. We didn’t actually need to build the script, it was enough to demonstrate the obvious weaknesses in the current processes in order to replace them. We would have built the script though.

## Make the host and the guest exchange roles (反客為主, Fǎn kè wéi zhǔ)

>Usurp leadership in a situation where one is normally subordinate. Infiltrate one's target. Initially, pretend to be a guest to be accepted, but develop from inside and become the owner later.

This is the tactic to use when a small group is attempting to bring change to a larger organization.

The consultant tactician is always in a subordinate position. No matter how expensive they are, the consultant is never given authority in a situation. Even when not doing so risks the entire initiative the permanent employees always have a stronger position, even if that authority just comes from their ability to escalate their concerns to human resources. A new permanent tactician often lacks authority simply by being new to the organization and lacking domain knowledge and the history of what’s been tried before and why it didn’t work.

The initial idea for this book was inspired by this tactic. When I first read it I had two thoughts simultaneously. One was that if I could arm a permanent employee who is frustrated by their inability to bring change into an organization they could be much more effective than any external consultant or new person. The second thought was that this book could provide a lot of consultants or new employees with some support as they entered into an organization and tried to apply influence most effectively.

There are a few techniques I’ve developed for becoming the host when I start as the guest. The first thing I do is find some common ground where I can fully support the host. Usually I am asked to implement DevOps ways of working and taking full advantage of new technologies and the approaches associated with them such as serverless computing. It’s easy for me to ally with my hosts on these as I have seen, first-hand, the benefits that arise from both of these approaches. I can throw myself into the project with enthusiasm and energy.

Having established myself as an ally I can then offer my support to any related initiatives that are struggling. In this way I can become the borrowed knife to other people within the organization. I can also provide a useful bridge for leadership team members who are not as in-touch with the latest technology by being able to talk about new approaches in terms they are familiar with. In order to do this it’s useful to learn what technologies they are familiar with and subtly walk them through the changes that have occurred since then. This bridging role turns the organization’s leadership team into a powerful distant ally. Being this bridge has two advantages for the tactician, the first is being seen as a trusted peer and confidant. The other advantage is that they can use this relationship to share any difficulties they are having with individuals in the teams and they can boost the most useful individuals. When insight into leadership thinking is shared with engineers giving them greater context for their work the engineers will repay this insight with trust. The engineers can see when action is taken to help team members who are struggling and when good work is recognized. particularly if this leads to promotion this then starts to convert the tactician into the host instead of the guest.

At Zoopla I was forced to move very quickly. I didn't have time to get to know the people or organization's problems before I had to establish new teams with new missions and get them working. As and when I could, I would find out who had good institutional knowledge so I could find out what had been tried before, what had worked, what had failed and attempt to understand the root cases for the current state Zoopla was in. These discussions would often offer up insights into who was good and who had good ideas but had struggled to get them taken seriously or make progress with them. That led me to looked for enthusiastic collaborators and good ideas or even solutions I could make use of. This let me have conversations with my contacts in the leadership team to find out what they thought of these people, ideas and solutions. I could share my opinions and get some conversation going. That naturally put me in a position to amplify good people, good ideas and good solutions and ask for help with people I was struggling with. These conversations also gave me the opportunity to share insights into what we were building. I could drop tidbits of information about the results we were achieving in the new initiative, which they could use with their peers and show they were close to the work. Doing this reasonably regularly eventually got me invited to help the leadership team with their strategic thinking and planning.

## The empty fort strategy (空城計, Kōng chéng jì)

>When the enemy has stronger forces and one expects to be overrun at any moment, act calmly and taunt the enemy, so that the enemy thinks they are walking into an ambush. This stratagem is only successful if in most cases one has a powerful hidden force...

The tactician must act calm and composed regardless of how desperate they are to bring about change. Without necessarily wishing to, people will oppose change at every turn. While acknowledging that an organization faces an existential threat, its people will inevitably provide numerous reasons why any change proposed is a mistake. The more passionate the agents of change become the more attack vectors appear. People complain that: “The change agents aren’t collaborative, they don’t understand the domain, they’re not suggesting anything new, what’s being suggested won’t deliver measurable benefits” The Empty Fort tactic plays on what seems to be a natural human propensity to mistake confidence for competence. The strategist must act as though they don’t care whether the organization changes or not. This removes firewood from under the pot of those who feel they have the most to lose from any change.

Probably the most extreme example of this was my first few months at Just Eat. Just Eat needed to improve the reliability of their service. Millions of pounds of revenue was being lost each month. The teams who owned the individual microservices that made up the platform were working to bring gradual improvements to their individual services but there was no holistic approach aimed at improving the platform as a whole. The teams were so committed to their approach that they were very resistant to any new suggestions, even ones that would seem obvious in any other organization.

I was tasked with helping teams identify opportunities to improve reliability that needed to span the whole platform, not just those ones that could be implemented by a team on their own. Even though leadership was supportive and I wanted to deliver some quick results to prove my worth I had to be very casual and friendly with my suggestions.

When there was an opportunity to make search more resilient by providing a pre-generated static version of search I had to work on multiple fronts simultaneously. I had to be very sympathetic with the team themselves. They were feeling very exposed as their service was the root cause of the last two serious outages. This meant I really needed to help them come up with a solution as opposed to imposing one on them. When we came up with the solution I had to support them in their interactions with other teams. Prior to this point every team just used each other’s APIs as they saw fit. In this case the Search team needed to provide other services with a client so that Search team could control when the pre-generated version was used. This also meant the old method of calling the Search API needed to be deprecated. In addition to this I had to help the product manager explain to their leadership that the Search team’s previous Key Performance Indicator (KPI) which was the percentage of bad orders wasn’t as important as being able to place an order at all.

## Let the enemy's own spy sow discord in the enemy camp (反間計, Fǎn jiàn jì)

>Undermine the enemy's ability to fight by secretly causing discord between them and their friends, allies, advisors, family, commanders, soldiers, and population. While they are preoccupied with settling internal disputes, their ability to attack or defend is compromised.

This tactic, as it stands, isn’t particularly useful to the tactician trying to bring change to a modern organization. Organizations with significant discord can’t be successfully changed. However the opposite of this tactic is also true. If there are potential allies in an organization then enhancing their effectiveness and helping them establish order in their domain and creating alliances between them will increase the overall effectiveness of an organization. As order coalesces from the chaos an organization’s confidence improves lending strength to all initiatives.

I earned an influential position at Zoopla. I supported a number of important initiatives and lent my support to good ideas that later became important initiatives. I also suppressed others that were not adding to the internal harmony of the organization. Some of the initiatives I supported have been mentioned earlier such as supporting the approach of the data team and ensuring the SEO team were respected and valued. I did these primarily because I knew I would need their help later but also because it helped me amplify the work of good people who were bringing harmony from the chaos. More controversially I deliberately left other teams alone. The Listings team, who processed all the listing data from estate agents to get it on to Zoopla were not on the journey with the rest of us in Product and Tech. They thought they could evolve their ageing tech stack rather than invest in a more modern, cloud native approach. I wished them all success, there were not bad people on that team they just made a different bet to me. However I didn’t lend my weight to their efforts and instead leant my support to the Search team who had to make the processed data usable and were embracing newer cloud-native approaches.

This provides us with another general lesson about how we can use military tactics for business purposes. Tactics that the military uses to disrupt their enemies can be reversed to look at how support can be lent to allies.

## Chain stratagems (連環計, Lián huán jì)

>In important matters, one should use several stratagems applied simultaneously after another as in a chain of stratagems. Keep different plans operating in an overall scheme; if any one strategy fails, apply the next strategy.

Tactics should be thought of like elements in an information flow diagram. Just as a function is applied to transform some data, a tactic is a pattern that can be applied to a transform an outcome. For any significant problem multiple tactics should be used together just as multiple functions can be used, some in different circumstances as the situation develops and unexpected challenges or opportunities present themselves.

## Conclusion

The tactics listed in this chapter are some of the most ancient recorded and yet all of them can have modern applications with just a little thought.

To tacticians out enemies are the problems that we need to solve.
The terrain the tactician operates on is knowledge, intellectual positions, opinion and feelings.
