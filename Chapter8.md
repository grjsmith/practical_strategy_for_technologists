# Writing a strategy

This chapter will present a few different formats for writing strategies. It will also present a number of essential documents, artefacts and processes that are needed to land a strategic message with all the necessary audiences and prepare the strategy for execution.

## Good Strategy/Bad Strategy

Good Strategy Bad Strategy: The Difference and Why it Matters by Richard Rumelt is an excellent book.

Rumelt has his own terminology that he explains in his book but he says strategy has three major components:

- A problem statement
- The overall approach
- A set of actions that comply with the overall approach and solve the problems defined in the problem statement statement.

Good Strategy/Bad Strategy then goes on to define all sorts of characteristics that make the difference between a good strategy and a bad strategy. Examples include:

- good strategies are coherent; different departments and divisions should be taking actions that reinforce or support each other aligned with the strategy.
- good strategy focuses multiple teams on an outcome and so it should also reinforce those teams when they reject certain work that would distract from executing against the strategy.
- bad strategy is word salad.
- bad strategy is just a list of objectives.

## Examples of good strategies and bad strategies

A lot of different types of organisations write strategies and share them. As a strategist studying the field care must be taken to identify the strategies that could have been written retrospectively. Governments and the military publish their strategies in advance. That makes them incredibly valuable resources because they aren't written to fit a narrative that has already been played out. They are both written to secure funding, which is generally why all strategies are written so they can be very useful to study.

Government strategies almost always lack a good problem statement. The reasons are probably different depending on the political system of the country. Government strategies are usually written by the civil service which uses a roll-up approach where teams and departments create strategy docs that are consumed by more senior civil servants who aggregate and summarise all the strategies of the departments that report to them. They then generate their strategies to be consumed by their ministers who then insert their requirements. These documents then get iterated on up and down that chain of command. This is true whether the strategy is generated from inside the civil service because the strategy is about the operation of the government or if the strategy originates from within the party that's in power because the strategy is to enact some policy.
