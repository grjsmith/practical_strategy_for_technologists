# Writing a strategy

This chapter will present a few different formats for writing strategies. It will also present a number of essential documents, artefacts and processes that are needed to land a strategic message with all the necessary audiences and prepare the strategy for execution.

## Good Strategy/Bad Strategy

Good Strategy Bad Strategy: The Difference and Why it Matters by Richard Rumelt is an excellent book.

Rumelt has his own terminology that he explains in his book but he says strategy has three major components:

- A problem statement
- The overall approach
- A set of actions that comply with the overall approach and solve the problems defined in the problem statement statement.

Good Strategy/Bad Strategy then goes on to define all sorts of characteristics that make the difference between a good strategy and a bad strategy. Examples include:

- good strategies are coherent; different departments and divisions should be taking actions that reinforce or support each other aligned with the strategy.
- good strategy focuses multiple teams on an outcome and so it should also reinforce those teams when they reject certain work that would distract from executing against the strategy.
- bad strategy is word salad.
- bad strategy is just a list of objectives.

## Examples of good strategies and bad strategies

A lot of different types of organisations write strategies and share them. As a strategist studying the field care must be taken to identify the strategies that could have been written retrospectively. Governments and the military publish their strategies in advance. That makes them incredibly valuable resources because they aren't written to fit a narrative that has already been played out.

Government strategies almost always lack a good problem statement. The reasons are probably different depending on the political system of the country. UK Government strategies are usually written by the civil service which uses a roll-up approach where teams and departments create strategy docs that are consumed by more senior civil servants who aggregate and summarise all the strategies of the departments that report to them. They then generate their strategies to be consumed by their ministers who then insert their requirements. These documents then get iterated on up and down the hierarchy. This is true whether the strategy is generated from inside the civil service because the strategy is about the operation of the government or if the strategy originates from within the party that's in power because the strategy is to enact policy.

### UK Digital Strategy

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uks-digital-strategy/uk-digital-strategy

This is an enormous 74 page strategy document. Already that makes it a bad strategy. It has a 7 page executive summary! In it's defense it has the role of laying out a technology strategy for a whole country. That is no excuse for this much wording. If you consider the approach to writing strategy in government that I described above numerous individual civil service department strategies will have been aggregated to form this document.

Reviewing the entire thing section by section would probably take half a book. Instead a couple of subheadings will be examined to try and discern what the problem statement is.

After the ministerial foreword the strategy lays out the context that it operates within it describes:

- the state of UK internet infrastructure and citizens access to the internet
- the state of the digital economy in terms of the business environment and skills availability
- three different points about how much private investment is available in the UK, the culture of innovation and the start up scene that the UK is known for across europe.

Having laid out the context the strategy then says:

>There are 4 foundational pillars upon which a vibrant, resilient and growing digital economy is built:
>
>1. robust digital infrastructure
>2. unlocking the power of data
>3. a light-touch pro-innovation regulatory framework
>4. a secure digital environment

This is the start of the solutions.

There are several consistent threads throughout each of these foundational pillars. They are:

Regulations restricting innovation or implementation are a problem and the government is making these easier to work with. More regulation is required for how citizens use the internet.

Research and Development will be through private investment or public investment through universities. Both of which will be encouraged by reducing the impact of regulation on innovation. Private investment will be additionally encourage through expanded R&D tax relief.

There are a few additional initiatives around education but the two main levers the government intends to use are reducing regulation to foster innovation and various grants and funds to continue R&D at universities and taxation incentives to encourage private companies to innovation.

This is where The approach of distilling the problem statement from the solution statements starts to fall apart. The UK Digital Strategy contains the word regulation 30 times and regulatory 31 times but only once mentions the specific regulations. Instead they refer to another document: Plan for digital regulation which in turn references a policy document: Digital Regulation: driving growth and unlocking innovation, which doesn't make mention of any specific changes although it does mention a few regulations and again makes a clear point about fostering investment.

#### UK Digital Strategy Review

The UK Digital Strategy is a bad strategy. It's enormous, and very difficult to consume. It has no problem statement. There are some solutions proposed but they are vague. No one reading this could ascertain whether an action taken by anyone was working towards the delivery of the strategy or against it.

### British Army: Land Operating Concept

The Land Operating Concept is a two page strategy. It lays out four clear problem statements.

> 1. Exposed - An exponential increase in both the quality and number of, advanced sensors and precision weapons is resulting in an expanded and more transparent battlefield. It is becoming much more difficult for soldiers to hide and survive.
> 2. Autonomous - The march of autonomous systems will continue. Developments in robotics on the ground, and especially in the air, are already forcing tactics to change. Meanwhile, Artificial Intelligence will see a step-change in the speed and accuracy of targeting and decision-making. Humans will remain in the loop but dependency on autonomous systems will grow.
> 3. Fragile - Adoption of advanced technologies means a greater reliance on data, software and the digital networks which connect them. A network’s links are inherently susceptible to interference, while its nodes are exposed by their broadcasts. If everything is connected, everything is vulnerable.
> 4. Observed - The prevalence of cameras, mobile technology and the internet means that combat increasingly takes place in a global goldfish bowl. With military actions being more closely scrutinised in real-time, maintaining surprise, deception and legitimacy will be more of a challenge.

It then lays out five solutions:

> 1. Fight by Recce-Strike - Recce-Strike is the intelligent combination of surveillance capabilities with artillery and other strike assets to find the enemy as far forward as possible and destroy them.
> 2. Adopt a new approach to survival - The protection of soldiers will be at the heart of the new strategy, due to the increased risk of being revealed by drones or electronic surveillance and struck by long-range missiles. Fighting forces will disperse, deceive and conceal themselves whilst hunting down the enemy’s artillery, surveillance assets, logistics chains and command nodes.
> 3. Exploit the electromagnetic spectrum and cyberspace - This will be a key determinant of success on a future battlefield given digital dependence on both sides. Outmanoeuvring, outpacing, and outmatching an opponent on this critical frontline will invariably lead to tactical advantage.
> 4. Reboot logistics to make them fit for the ‘Precision Age’ - The reach and accuracy of contemporary and future artillery places traditional approaches to logistics, and the resupply of land forces, in jeopardy...The new approach will draw upon dispersal, concealment, forward manufacture, and repair, as well as contracted support to offset the challenges of a more dispersed and expanded battlefield.
> 5. Seize the initiative in the information environment - Land forces must increase the speed, reach and sophistication of their information warfare capabilities to set the conditions for success before conflict and to quickly help shape perceptions if a crisis unfolds.

#### British Army: Land Operating Concept Review

Concisely stated and unambiguous problem statements that are linked by an underlying theme. That theme comes across even stronger for anyone who has been following events in Ukraine.

Clear solutions that present both an overall approach that acts as a thread through all the solutions but also clear actions.

Anyone in the British Army or any of it's partners implementing any task could easily check whether what they are doing will help or hinder this strategy.

Both the British Army and UK Government strategy are huge in scope. Both these strategies have far reaching impacts on organisations all around the world, a large number of direct employees day-to-day lives will be different as a result of these strategies. One is clear, concise, actionable and can be used as test for any activity. The other one is hard to consume, makes very few clear statements, has no problem statement and can't be used to distill any kind of clear actions let alone determine if a task supports or obstructs the strategy.

### Australian Government Data Strategy 2021-2024

https://www.industry.gov.au/publications/data-strategy-2021-2024/strategy-glance

The Australian Government data strategy is a three page document. It has vision and context sections, it references, the preceding strategy and what was achieved. It then lays out a series of priorities:

>1. Capability and culture – from data literacy to data fluency
>2. Governance – optimise our data governance and management
>3. Analytics – best-practice, fit-for-purpose analytics
>4. Location-based insights – enable greater use of location data

Then it lays out a series of challenges:

>1. Using data to respond to, support and implement the government’s priorities
>2. Strong data culture and analytical capability is not uniform across our department.
>3. Growing number and complexity of policy and program functions, business systems and data holdings.
>4. A changing data and technology landscape, including the Data Availability and Transparency Bill 2020.

and a series of opportunities:

>1. Provide better data and evidence to support government priorities and address implementation challenges.
>2. Build a data-driven culture and increase our technical capabilities by engaging experts and leaders who can share their knowledge.
>3. Integrate functions and data sources to improve our policy and program capability.
>4. Use new technologies and data-sharing frameworks to provide new ways to manage, use and share data.

#### Australian Government Data Strategy 2021-2024 Review

The Australian Government Data Strategy takes an intelligent approach to problem statements. Instead of just stating clear problem instead it expresses needs and challenges. These are clear and would be easy to dispute or support for anyone trying to implement the strategy in their team or department.

There are a clear set of priorities that are built on a previous set of priorities. So there is clear progression and a sense of a journey.

## Supporting artefacts

One of the common problems people new to strategy experience when trying to create one is trying to solve too many problems in one document. The solution is to recognise that strategies don't exist in isolation.

The strategy just needs to present the problems and solutions in a way that's easy for it's audience to understand. The strategy doesn't have to design an organisation structure or an operating model, it doesn't need to communicate all the changes that will take place in order to achieve the strategy, it doesn't have to change processes or introduce or change governance, technology or the skills, knowledge and capability of the people who will be implementing it.

All those things can be done in different artefacts. The strategist will most likely be creating their strategy for and with people who are not comfortable with strategy. Some of those people will have achieved their positions because they pay close attention to detail. Those people will struggle with statements that lay out solutions but don't provide a step-by-step guide to implementing them. The strategist needs to take these people on a journey through these additional artefacts to make best use of these people's capabilities but also to allow the strategy to be as simple as it needs to be.

### Operating model

Operating models are a concise statement about the primary functions of the business, they usually attempt to represent those functions visually. The idea is that anyone in the organisation can see their function represented in the operating model and see how their function will work with people, process, technology and data. Operating models are a great way to make sure the primary functions of the business are appropriately optimised. Operating models are one step below the strategy, in terms of abstraction from the detailed work. 





## Conclusion

Strategies are for solving complex problems that are large in scope They don't have to be national or global problems they can be for solving problems on an individual team level but there's not much point having a strategy to solve a simple problem that just needs a plan to be agreed with a few people. However the strategy itself mustn't be large and complex if people are to understand it, share it with each other and then use it to plan their actions or check whether they are doing the right things.

Achieving the kind of simplicity that renders the solution to a large and complex problem into a short sentence or two of text is incredibly difficult and time consuming. That's one of the reasons finding good strategy is uncommon in product and technology organisations, that and very few people know what a strategy is or what it's supposed to do.
