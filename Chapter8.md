# Writing a strategy

This chapter will present a few different formats for writing strategies. It will also present a number of essential documents, artefacts and processes that are needed to land a strategic message with all the necessary audiences and prepare the strategy for execution.

## Good Strategy/Bad Strategy

Good Strategy Bad Strategy: The Difference and Why it Matters by Richard Rumelt is an excellent book. I wish I'd read it sooner.
