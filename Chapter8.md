# Writing a strategy

This chapter will present a few different formats for writing strategies. It will also present a number of essential documents, artefacts and processes that are needed to land a strategic message with all the necessary audiences and prepare the strategy for execution.

## Good Strategy/Bad Strategy

Good Strategy Bad Strategy: The Difference and Why it Matters by Richard Rumelt is an excellent book.

Rumelt has his own terminology that he explains in his book but he says strategy has three major components:

- A problem statement
- The overall approach
- A set of actions that comply with the overall approach and solve the problems defined in the problem statement statement.

Good Strategy/Bad Strategy then goes on to define all sorts of characteristics that make the difference between a good strategy and a bad strategy. Examples include:

- good strategies are coherent; different departments and divisions should be taking actions that reinforce or support each other aligned with the strategy.
- good strategy focuses multiple teams on an outcome and so it should also reinforce those teams when they reject certain work that would distract from executing against the strategy.
- bad strategy is word salad.
- bad strategy is just a list of objectives.

## Examples of good strategies and bad strategies

A lot of different types of organisations write strategies and share them. As a strategist studying the field care must be taken to identify the strategies that could have been written retrospectively. Governments and the military publish their strategies in advance. That makes them incredibly valuable resources because they aren't written to fit a narrative that has already been played out. They are both written to secure funding, which is generally why all strategies are written so they can be very useful to study.

Government strategies almost always lack a good problem statement. The reasons are probably different depending on the political system of the country. Government strategies are usually written by the civil service which uses a roll-up approach where teams and departments create strategy docs that are consumed by more senior civil servants who aggregate and summarise all the strategies of the departments that report to them. They then generate their strategies to be consumed by their ministers who then insert their requirements. These documents then get iterated on up and down that chain of command. This is true whether the strategy is generated from inside the civil service because the strategy is about the operation of the government or if the strategy originates from within the party that's in power because the strategy is to enact policy.

In the UK neither the government in power or the civil service can afford to admit there are any problems. Any admission of this kind would create a very noisy press cycle. This would be deemed the height of political naivety in the civil service. At first thought this might lead to the conclusion that government can't create good strategy. However with just a little context and thought the problem statements can be derived from what the strategy aims to achieve.

### UK Digital Strategy

This is an enormous 74 page strategy document. Already that makes it a bad strategy. It has a 7 page executive summary! In it's defense it has the role of laying out a technology strategy for a whole country. That is no excuse for this much wording. If you consider the approach to writing strategy in government that I described above numerous individual civil service department strategies will have been aggregated to form this document.

Reviewing the entire thing section by section would probably take half a book. Instead a couple of subheadings will be examined to try and discern what the problem statement is.

After the ministerial foreword the strategy lays out the context that it operates within it describes:

- the state of UK internet infrastructure and citizens access to the internet
- the state of the digital economy in terms of the business environment and skills availability
- three different points about how much private investment is available in the UK, the culture of innovation and the start up scene that the UK is known for across europe.

Having laid out the context the strategy then says:

>There are 4 foundational pillars upon which a vibrant, resilient and growing digital economy is built:
>
>1. robust digital infrastructure
>2. unlocking the power of data
>3. a light-touch pro-innovation regulatory framework
>4. a secure digital environment

This is the start of the solutions or what Rumelt described
