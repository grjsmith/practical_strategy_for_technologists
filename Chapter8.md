# Writing a strategy

This chapter will present a few different formats for writing strategies. It will also present a number of essential documents, artefacts and processes that are needed to land a strategic message with all the necessary audiences and prepare the strategy for execution.

## Good Strategy/Bad Strategy

Good Strategy Bad Strategy: The Difference and Why it Matters by Richard Rumelt is an excellent book.

Rumelt has his own terminology that he explains in his book but he says strategy has three major components:

- A problem statement
- The overall approach
- A set of actions that comply with the overall approach and solve the problems defined in the problem statement statement.

Good Strategy/Bad Strategy then goes on to define all sorts of characteristics that make the difference between a good strategy and a bad strategy. Examples include:

- good strategies are coherent; different departments and divisions should be taking actions that reinforce or support each other aligned with the strategy.
- good strategy focuses multiple teams on an outcome and so it should also reinforce those teams when they reject certain work that would distract from executing against the strategy.
- bad strategy is word salad.
- bad strategy is just a list of objectives.

## Examples of good strategies and bad strategies

A lot of different types of organisations write strategies and share them. As a strategist studying the field care must be taken to identify the strategies that could have been written retrospectively. Governments and the military publish their strategies in advance. That makes them incredibly valuable resources because they aren't written to fit a narrative that has already been played out.

Government strategies almost always lack a good problem statement. The reasons are probably different depending on the political system of the country. UK Government strategies are usually written by the civil service which uses a roll-up approach where teams and departments create strategy docs that are consumed by more senior civil servants who aggregate and summarise all the strategies of the departments that report to them. They then generate their strategies to be consumed by their ministers who then insert their requirements. These documents then get iterated on up and down the hierarchy. This is true whether the strategy is generated from inside the civil service because the strategy is about the operation of the government or if the strategy originates from within the party that's in power because the strategy is to enact policy.

### UK Digital Strategy

https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uks-digital-strategy/uk-digital-strategy

This is an enormous 74 page strategy document. Already that makes it a bad strategy. It has a 7 page executive summary! In it's defense it has the role of laying out a technology strategy for a whole country. That is no excuse for this much wording. If you consider the approach to writing strategy in government that I described above numerous individual civil service department strategies will have been aggregated to form this document.

Reviewing the entire thing section by section would probably take half a book. Instead a couple of subheadings will be examined to try and discern what the problem statement is.

After the ministerial foreword the strategy lays out the context that it operates within it describes:

- the state of UK internet infrastructure and citizens access to the internet
- the state of the digital economy in terms of the business environment and skills availability
- three different points about how much private investment is available in the UK, the culture of innovation and the start up scene that the UK is known for across europe.

Having laid out the context the strategy then says:

>There are 4 foundational pillars upon which a vibrant, resilient and growing digital economy is built:
>
>1. robust digital infrastructure
>2. unlocking the power of data
>3. a light-touch pro-innovation regulatory framework
>4. a secure digital environment

This is the start of the solutions.

There are several consistent threads throughout each of these foundational pillars. They are:

Regulations restricting innovation or implementation are a problem and the government is making these easier to work with. More regulation is required for how citizens use the internet.

Research and Development will be through private investment or public investment through universities. Both of which will be encouraged by reducing the impact of regulation on innovation. Private investment will be additionally encourage through expanded R&D tax relief.

There are a few additional initiatives around education but the two main levers the government intends to use are reducing regulation to foster innovation and various grants and funds to continue R&D at universities and taxation incentives to encourage private companies to innovation.

This is where The approach of distilling the problem statement from the solution statements starts to fall apart. The UK Digital Strategy contains the word regulation 30 times and regulatory 31 times but only once mentions the specific regulations. Instead they refer to another document: Plan for digital regulation which in turn references a policy document: Digital Regulation: driving growth and unlocking innovation, which doesn't make mention of any specific changes although it does mention a few regulations and again makes a clear point about fostering investment.

#### UK Digital Strategy Review

The UK Digital Strategy is a bad strategy. It's enormous, and very difficult to consume. It has no problem statement. There are some solutions proposed but they are vague. No one reading this could ascertain whether an action taken by anyone was working towards the delivery of the strategy or against it.

### British Army: Land Operating Concept

The Land Operating Concept is a two page strategy. It lays out four clear problem statements.

> 1. Exposed - An exponential increase in both the quality and number of, advanced sensors and precision weapons is resulting in an expanded and more transparent battlefield. It is becoming much more difficult for soldiers to hide and survive.
> 2. Autonomous - The march of autonomous systems will continue. Developments in robotics on the ground, and especially in the air, are already forcing tactics to change. Meanwhile, Artificial Intelligence will see a step-change in the speed and accuracy of targeting and decision-making. Humans will remain in the loop but dependency on autonomous systems will grow.
> 3. Fragile - Adoption of advanced technologies means a greater reliance on data, software and the digital networks which connect them. A network’s links are inherently susceptible to interference, while its nodes are exposed by their broadcasts. If everything is connected, everything is vulnerable.
> 4. Observed - The prevalence of cameras, mobile technology and the internet means that combat increasingly takes place in a global goldfish bowl. With military actions being more closely scrutinised in real-time, maintaining surprise, deception and legitimacy will be more of a challenge.

It then lays out five solutions:

> 1. Fight by Recce-Strike - Recce-Strike is the intelligent combination of surveillance capabilities with artillery and other strike assets to find the enemy as far forward as possible and destroy them.
> 2. Adopt a new approach to survival - The protection of soldiers will be at the heart of the new strategy, due to the increased risk of being revealed by drones or electronic surveillance and struck by long-range missiles. Fighting forces will disperse, deceive and conceal themselves whilst hunting down the enemy’s artillery, surveillance assets, logistics chains and command nodes.
> 3. Exploit the electromagnetic spectrum and cyberspace - This will be a key determinant of success on a future battlefield given digital dependence on both sides. Outmanoeuvring, outpacing, and outmatching an opponent on this critical frontline will invariably lead to tactical advantage.
> 4. Reboot logistics to make them fit for the ‘Precision Age’ - The reach and accuracy of contemporary and future artillery places traditional approaches to logistics, and the resupply of land forces, in jeopardy...The new approach will draw upon dispersal, concealment, forward manufacture, and repair, as well as contracted support to offset the challenges of a more dispersed and expanded battlefield.
> 5. Seize the initiative in the information environment - Land forces must increase the speed, reach and sophistication of their information warfare capabilities to set the conditions for success before conflict and to quickly help shape perceptions if a crisis unfolds.

#### British Army: Land Operating Concept Review

Concisely stated and unambiguous problem statements that are linked by an underlying theme. That theme comes across even stronger for anyone who has been following events in Ukraine.

Clear solutions that present both an overall approach that acts as a thread through all the solutions but also clear actions.

Anyone in the British Army or any of it's partners implementing any task could easily check whether what they are doing will help or hinder this strategy.

Both the British Army and UK Government strategy are huge in scope. Both these strategies have far reaching impacts on organisations all around the world, a large number of direct employees day-to-day lives will be different as a result of these strategies. One is clear, concise, actionable and can be used as test for any activity. The other one is hard to consume, makes very few clear statements, has no problem statement and can't be used to distill any kind of clear actions let alone determine if a task supports or obstructs the strategy.

### Australian Government Data Strategy 2021-2024

https://www.industry.gov.au/publications/data-strategy-2021-2024/strategy-glance

The Australian Government data strategy is a three page document. It has vision and context sections, it references, the preceding strategy and what was achieved. It then lays out a series of priorities:

>1. Capability and culture – from data literacy to data fluency
>2. Governance – optimise our data governance and management
>3. Analytics – best-practice, fit-for-purpose analytics
>4. Location-based insights – enable greater use of location data

Then it lays out a series of challenges:

>1. Using data to respond to, support and implement the government’s priorities
>2. Strong data culture and analytical capability is not uniform across our department.
>3. Growing number and complexity of policy and program functions, business systems and data holdings.
>4. A changing data and technology landscape, including the Data Availability and Transparency Bill 2020.

and a series of opportunities:

>1. Provide better data and evidence to support government priorities and address implementation challenges.
>2. Build a data-driven culture and increase our technical capabilities by engaging experts and leaders who can share their knowledge.
>3. Integrate functions and data sources to improve our policy and program capability.
>4. Use new technologies and data-sharing frameworks to provide new ways to manage, use and share data.

#### Australian Government Data Strategy 2021-2024 Review

The Australian Government Data Strategy takes an intelligent approach to problem statements. Instead of just stating clear problem instead it expresses needs and challenges. These are clear and would be easy to dispute or support for anyone trying to implement the strategy in their team or department.

There are a clear set of priorities that are built on a previous set of priorities. So there is clear progression and a sense of a journey.

## Supporting artefacts

One of the common problems people new to strategy experience is trying to solve too many problems with one document. The solution is to recognise that strategies don't exist in isolation.

The strategy just needs to present the problems and solutions in a way that's easy for it's audience to understand. The strategy doesn't have to design an organisation structure or an operating model, it doesn't need to communicate all the changes that will take place in order to achieve the strategy, it doesn't have to change processes or introduce or change governance, technology or the skills, knowledge and capability of the people who will be implementing it. The strategy also doesn't need to communicate to everyone impact by itself.

All those things can be done in different artefacts. The strategist will most likely be creating their strategy for and with people who are not familiar with strategy. Some of those people will have achieved their positions because they pay close attention to detail. Those people will struggle with statements that lay out solutions but don't provide a step-by-step guide to implementing them. The strategist needs to take these people on a journey through these additional artefacts to make best use of these people's capabilities but also to allow the strategy to be as simple as it needs to be.

### Operating model

Operating models (introduced in chapter 7) are a concise statement about the primary functions of the business and how they interact. Operating models are usually presented with a graphical presentation.

The term primary functions means revenue generating or essential to support revenue generating functions everyday. Operating models will not show Human Resources, Finance, Legal or internal technical support functions. That isn't to say that a business doesn't need these functions but they don't need them every minute of everyday in to deliver services to customers.

The value of an operating model is that all the primary business functions are displayed on a single page. Relationships between each function are made clear by their relative position. Functions that operate in series will be presented in some sort of linear flow. Functions that operate in parallel, like platform services that service several functions, will be shown making it clear they have relationships with other functions simultaneously.

In the very largest organisations operating models will be quite abstract often ignoring that the business is split into geographic territories. In smaller organisations the operating model maybe quite detailed in that it might name specific departments or even teams.

The operating model has two primary purposes. The first is to go into a little more detail about how the strategy will be executed. Specifically which functions will exist and what relationships they will have with each other to a support the execution of the strategy. The second purpose is testing. The operating model is the first test to determine if the organisation can execute the strategy. If the strategy requires two, currently separate functions, to work closely together it might highlight that a customer-client relationship will be subject to prioritisation problems and might cause the separation of those functions to be reconsidered. The operating model isn't just testing whether the strategy can be executed it might also be used to call into question the strategy itself. If the business isn't currently organised to execute the strategy that might mean the business needs to be re-organised but it might also mean that the strategy is inappropriate for this business as it currently is. There is a trap for the unwary strategist here. A strategy can never be too ambitious. This concern may be raised by those unfamiliar with strategy. When they are looking at the strategy and looking to find a plan but can't find one they will either conclude that the strategy is nonsense because it has no plan or that it's too ambitious because this business isn't ready for the kind of vision being proposed. If a business is currently ready for a given strategy, it doesn't need a strategy it just needs a plan.

The second set of tests happens when the strategy and the operating model are published. Anyone in the organisation, who is involved in the businesses primary functions will see the sorts of relationships they are expected to have with other functions of the business and they can examine it and determine how their function will need to change and how their relationships with other functions will change. This might highlight inefficiencies that may have to be mitigated.

A great example of where this has value is when a business is considering creating a platform type function. The operating model explicitly calls out who that platform function is providing services to and everyone can see how many different types of interactions they'll need to support. That then leads to the next set of questions about capacity and the variety of expertise that will be needed in that platform function. This is a great way to determine how technology functions should operate in businesses.

-------------------insert some example operating models

The strategy describes what the business is going to do. The operating model follows it and describes what functions the business will need in order to execute the strategy.

### The organisational structure

Once an operating model has been designed, the next action is create an organisational structure. The creation of the organisational structure is another opportunity to test the strategy and the first opportunity to test the operating model. The organisational structure is the next level down in detail explaining how the business will execute the strategy. This is where territory divisions can be shown. The organisational structure isn't limited to just primary business functions but every function, including supporting functions.

The creation of the organisational structure presents an opportunity to identify specific, detailed problems that will hinder the execution of the strategy. This is where the subject matter experts and those whose strengths are attention to detail come into their own.

The first problem the organisation structure highlights is span of control. The organisational structure will show if a particular business function is actually several distinct functions hiding in one box on the operating model diagram. Span of control also refers to  how many people are being managed by an individual. The organisational chart exposes this clearly for all to see.

The second problem the organisational structure highlights is duplication. In larger organisations where the business has created divisions by product or by territory it's common to find useful functions to be replicated. Business intelligence functions are commonly replicated because they are so useful. Everyone needs data to make good decisions. So if a particular territory or division needs data and constantly finds it's needs deprioritised it will find a way to fund the creation of it's own data function. This is known as Shadow IT. If this hasn't shown up during the creation of the operating model, it will definitely show up during the creation of the organisational structure. When these duplications are found they should cause the operating model to be inspected again. Thought should be given as to whether there should be a single platform servicing all the teams or whether that caused this problem in the first place and whether a hub and spoke or self-service model or hybrid should be considered. This should also raise questions about whether appropriate data governance was being followed by all these additional business intelligence functions.

### Principles, behaviours, processes, training and expectations

The strategy considers the business as a whole, the environment it operates in and the customers it services. The operating model zooms in on the business and describes how it operates. The organisational structure zooms in further and considers divisions, products, territories, departments and teams. The last level to look at is the people, processes and technologies and whether they are ready to execute the strategy. Initially this manifests itself in the question: "...but are our people capable of working in this way?"

Discussed extensively in Chapter 4, **principles, behaviours, processes, training and expectations** are what prepare an individual to perform their role in the strategy.

This is the next test of the organisational structure and the operating model. At this stage the strategy has been through numerous tests, as has the operating model. The operating model was the first place that assumptions about the organisation and it's capabilities were made. When the organisational structure was created these assumptions were acceptable because they would be tested by the organisational structure. With the organisational structure in place the next level of detail is to identify if each division, department and team is capable of operating as it is being asked to. If the answer to these questions is ever no. Then it's time to make sure that what is being asked by the organisational structure is reasonable. Are there teams with too many customers with disparate needs? Are some teams being asked to be expert in too many things? Is the strategy pushing the organisation to focus on a lot of new things and the organisational structure has focused exclusively on new things and not sufficiently on those functions that, currently, generate all the revenue?

If all of that is in order then it is time to focus on the people themselves and preparing to give them what they need in order to play their part.

### The communication plan

The final part of the pre-work before executing the strategy is communicating the strategy and the organisational changes. Communicating a strategy is as complicated as executing the strategy. A great deal of care must be taken in designing and planning the communication.

The communication plan presents the last opportunity to test the strategy, the operating model, the organisation structure and all the actions that need to be taken to get the organisation ready to execute the strategy. If the strategy hasn't already been tested with finance, legal, HR, IT, security, facilities and the governance and compliance organisations this is the last responsible moment to engage with those groups. It must still be possible to change everything, including the strategy at this point. If these organisations are considered to be primary business functions or if they have a significant partner relationship with the primary business functions then they may have been involved but if not now is the time to do it. These functions may bring important insights that might change the strategy and if not the strategy they will have useful insights into how the organisation will execute the strategy. The only reason not to involve them until this point is to keep the working group small, making progress faster.

The first thing to know about the communication plan is that there will not be one communication to rule them all. Communication needs to be context sensitive so the message to the board should be different to the one for the senior leadership team. That message should be entirely different to the messages that are sent to directors, heads of department, managers and the people in the teams. The teams are not homogenous either and so there should be different messages targeted at their specific needs and concerns. People in Customer Care have a different set of needs and concerns than the people building software and the HR team.

There is often a concern raised about consistency at this point. Two messages aimed at two different groups can be entirely consistent with each other and yet have completely different content because the two groups have different needs from that message. This is why there is a need for a communication plan because there will be a few key points to get across to everyone regardless of their role. These key points need to be made in such a way that everyone understands them and the only way to achieve that is if the message is specifically customised for all the different groups of people who will be affected by the strategy. This is true even if a group doesn't actually have to do anything different to execute the strategy. If they hear nothing or if they hear a generic message they are going to be wondering how it affects them. So even if teams aren't affected it should be made clear to them what's happening and why they don't have to do anything different.

One of the difficulties in communicating strategy is that an organisation, or maybe even a group of teams in an organisation might not be in the right place to hear a strategy. If the business has been through a lot of change recently or has lost some key people or there has been some significant environmental change that makes the people in those teams feel threatened then they will be in survival mode and cannot rationally think about a long term future. Care must be taken in these situations to decide how to manage this situation. Ideally these people need to be helped to get back to a position of psychological safety so that they can engage with the strategy. This isn't always possible and in those cases these people will need additional support and care and this also needs to be taken into account by the communication plan. The answer might be to limit the communication of the strategy to focus on some nearer term changes and choose not to share the whole strategy just yet. This is a great opportunity to communicate some smaller-scope changes such as creating a platform team or embracing a more cloud-native approach as a precursor to a more ambitious round of changes and communication that will come later when people are ready to hear it.

## Conclusion

Strategies are for solving complex problems that are large in scope They don't have to be national or global problems they can be for solving problems on an individual team level but there's not much point having a strategy to solve a simple problem that just needs a plan to be agreed upon by a few people. However the strategy itself mustn't be large and complex if people are to understand it, share it with each other and then use it to plan their actions or check whether they are doing the right things.

Achieving the kind of simplicity that renders the solution to a large and complex problem into a short sentence or two of text is incredibly difficult and time consuming. That's one of the reasons finding good strategy is uncommon in product and technology organisations, that and very few people know what a strategy is or what it's supposed to do.

Finally, a strategy can be made to be easily understood because it really only has to explain the problems and solutions backed by a theme or two. There are a variety of other documents that describe how the strategy will be executed and these go into finer and finer details until everyone in the organisation understands exactly what's expected of them.
