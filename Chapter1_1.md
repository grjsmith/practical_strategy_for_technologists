# Chapter 1: Strategy, Tactics and Planning

## Strategy

When a large organisation wants to change itself, it's capabilities or make some significant impact on the world it will create a strategy. Strategies are usually unique to an organisation and what they are trying to achieve. As such there are few reusable strategies. Some notable examples of strategies include:

- Southwest airlines' Greyhound for the skies strategy
- Apple's ecosystem strategy
- AOL's so easy we're number one

Southwest Airlines disrupted domestic air travel in the US by deliberately offering what their competition didn't. They flew point-to-point to smaller locations and alternative airports in larger cities. They offered price-conscious travellers an alternative to their cars and busses.

Apple's technology is based on well-respected open standards software and yet Apple products only work well with Apple software and other Apple devices. This is a concerted strategy to up-sell and cross-sell things customers already have so they can use those things with their apple products. This strategy has been wildly successful for Apple making it one of the most valuable companies in the world.

America Online was just another internet service provider in 1999 but a focus on offering a premium service catering specifically for non-technical people propelled it to being the biggest internet service provider in the world throughout the early 2000's.

These strategies are all unique to the industry and to the company that created them. Their competitors were forced to adapt either with their own strategy or by improving operational efficiency.

Just creating a strategy doesn't make the world a different place overnight. There are a number of next steps that an organisation needs to take to implement the strategy. The organisation, it's people and the tools they use all might need to undergo significant changes just to get the capability and capacity to implement the strategy.

## Tactics

While strategies are, by their nature, unique to a company, industry and even a time, tactics are not. Tactics are the ways in which teams and people execute a strategy. In Technology businesses we have a plethora of tactics that are repeatable patterns that we use and reuse. 

In the military tactics have been learned, shared and taught for millennia.
