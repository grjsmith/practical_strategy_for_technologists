# Chapter 1: Strategy, Tactics and Planning

## Strategy

When a large organisation wants to change itself, it's capabilities or make some significant impact on the world it will create a strategy. Strategies are usually unique to an organisation, their environment, economic conditions and what they are trying to achieve. As such there are few reusable strategies. Some notable examples of strategies include:

- Southwest airlines' Greyhound for the skies strategy
- Apple's ecosystem strategy
- AOL's so easy we're number one

Southwest Airlines disrupted domestic air travel in the US by deliberately offering what their competition didn't. They flew point-to-point to smaller locations and alternative airports in larger cities. They offered price-conscious travellers an alternative to their cars and busses.

Apple's technology is based on well-respected open standards software and yet Apple products only work well with Apple software and other Apple devices. This is a concerted strategy to up-sell and cross-sell things customers already have so they can use those things with their apple products. This strategy has been wildly successful for Apple making it one of the most valuable companies in the world.

America Online was just another internet service provider in 1999 but a focus on offering a premium service catering specifically for non-technical people propelled it to being the biggest internet service provider in the world throughout the early 2000's.

These strategies are all unique to the industry, the company that created them and the time in which they were operating. Their competitors were forced to adapt either with their own strategy or by improving operational efficiency.

Just creating a strategy doesn't make the world a different place overnight. There are a number of next steps that an organisation needs to take to implement the strategy. The organisation, it's people and the tools they use all might need to undergo significant changes just to get the capability and capacity to implement the strategy.

The word strategy is over-used and often misused to the point where it's almost become meaningless. The dictionary definition of strategy isn't very helpful in helping us understand what a strategy is. There are several different dictionaries in use throughout the world their definitions of strategy tend run along these lines:

>**strategy** /ˈstratɪdʒi/ (noun).
>
> a plan of action designed to achieve a long-term or overall aim. "time to develop a coherent economic strategy"
>
> the art of planning and directing overall military operations and movements in a war or battle.
>"he was a genius when it came to military strategy"

Richard Rumelt, author of Good Strategy/Bad Strategy, in an interview with Mckinsey once described Strategy as:

>Strategy is problem-solving. It is how you overcome the obstacles that stand between where you are and what you want to achieve.

(source: https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/why-bad-strategy-is-a-social-contagion)

That's as good a definition as any for us to work with. A strategy is _how_ an organisation overcomes the obstacles that stand in the way of their success. What happens next is what we'll examine in this book. Once an organisation has a strategy, they have defined how they want to achieve success. What happens next?

As suggested by the title of this chapter the answer isn't planning. Planning is what we do once we know what we need our teams to achieve. There is an essential step between formulating a strategy and building a plan and executing it. That step is identifying tactics.

## Tactics

Strategies are, by their nature, unique to a company, industry and even the time-period they are operating in. Tactics are not unique. Tactics are the ways in which teams and people identify how they will contribute to a strategy. In Technology businesses we have a plethora of tactics that are repeatable patterns that we use and reuse.

If you've ever been part of a team and unsure how your team is contributing to the organisation's strategy then you are not alone. Very few organisations understand the link between strategy, tactics and planning. One organisation that absolutely understands that link and has done for millennia is the military.
