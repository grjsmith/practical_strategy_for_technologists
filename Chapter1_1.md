# Chapter 1: Strategy, Tactics and Planning

When a large organisation wants to change itself or it's capabilities or make some significant impact on the world it will create a strategy.

Over the years I've been a part of many businesses some of them were very focused on strategies, some were more interested in operational effectiveness.
