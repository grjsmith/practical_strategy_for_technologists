# Chapter 2: Prerequisites for executing a strategy

The new definition of a strategy, proposed in chapter one mentions conditions:
**An identifiable pattern of actions that when performed in similar conditions will achieve the same results each time.** This chapter will examine some of those conditions that the strategist needs to consider and exert some influence over before executing their strategy. The idea is to make those conditions as conducive to success as possible.

## Sun Tzu’s Art of War

A two-and-a-half thousand year old military treatise provides a great structure for considering the conditions under which a strategy is executed. In his first chapter Sun Tzu writes:

>The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one's deliberations, when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field.<br>
These are: **The Moral Law; Heaven; Earth; The Commander; Method and discipline.**<br>
The **moral law** causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger.
**Heaven** signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.<br>
**Earth** comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.<br>
**The Commander** stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage and strictness.<br>
**By Method and discipline**  are to be understood the marshalling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure.

Looking at these through the lens of the 21st century it can be seen that what was true for a 5th century general is just as true for business leaders today.

The **moral law** refers to the morale of the people in our teams. In order to execute a strategy successfully our people must believe that we’re doing the right thing for the right reasons. In product and technology organisations our people are intelligent and need to understand the wider context they are working in. The strategist needs to rely on the people in their teams achieving a succession of tactical objectives in order for the strategy to be successful. The support of the teams therefore is essential to the successful execution of a strategy. When people are crying out for strategy they’re telling their leaders that they have the support of the teams and the teams now want to deliver something significant, they want to be formed into something greater than they are individually and to achieve something that none of them could achieve on their own.

**Heaven** signifies the temporal conditions affecting teams. Seasonality is a major factor in some businesses. Businesses with personalised gift products and florists are entirely dependent on Valentines day, Mothers day, Christmas and other significant holidays. Ecommerce businesses depend on black Friday and Christmas. Some European businesses shut down during the summer if another business depends on these companies then they need to plan for this seasonal disruption. All businesses operate in one or more timezones. Global businesses get a few quiet hours a day, while the sun is over the pacific and trading relaxes a little, businesses operating in just one or a few time zones don’t need the same kind of resiliency as they can work on systems during their quiet periods overnight. Many businesses have staff in different timezones. These businesses need to structure their work such that work that needs collaboration is done in the Goldilocks time when people in the different regions are online together. In more extreme cases where there is no Goldilocks time the work needs to be managed asynchronously and this requires a completely different approach. All of these factors must be considered, they have their advantages as well as their disadvantages that the strategist needs to design for.

**Earth** represents the physical conditions the strategist needs to factor in. The most obvious ones being the ones Sun Tzu mentioned himself: distances, open ground, narrow passes. Logistics businesses invest a great deal in technology to optimise deliveries. Earth also includes dangers and security. The importance of security and the dangers inherent in not prioritising security appropriately include everything from fines to existential threats depending on the nature of the threat. Prioritising security appropriately includes the risks of over prioritising as well as under prioritising. Businesses that focus too much on security find themselves unable to keep up with their markets which presents a different existential threat.

The strategist needs a compelling leader for the teams to rally to, this is Sun Tzu’s **commander**. The attributes that Sun Tzu calls out are still important today. The leader needs to stand for these attributes, not literally embody them. The leader is the avatar of the strategy. Their role, in this regard is presenting the perception that they are wise, sincere, benevolent, courageous and in control and then, by inference, so must any strategy they are executing be.

- Wisdom: Our people are intelligent but their horizons are relatively short. They must feel they are led by someone with a broad vision and a long perspective. This is how wisdom appears from the outside. If the teams feel they are led by someone wise they are free to focus all their attention on the problems they’ve been given to solve.
- Sincerity: Nothing undermines confidence in someone faster than when their actions don’t match their words. A leader who appears sincere creates a psychologically safe environment. This encourages courage and innovation in the teams that can create emergent opportunities the strategist can take advantage of.
- Benevolence: Being led by people who think of their teams only as rows on a spreadsheet has an enormous impact on teams. If this is the perception then the most mobile people will just leave and those who feel less able to just pull up their roots and find another job are encouraged to play safe and try to stay beneath notice. These behaviours will not lead to the successful execution of a strategy or anything beyond maintenance of the status quo.
- Courage: The teams must feel they are being actively led. If they feel their work is directed by the whims of a cabal they will lose confidence in their leadership and any strategy they are executing. They must see that their leader is striving towards the same goal they are. This means they must see their leader overcoming obstacles just as they are. This is what courage looks like from the outside.
- Strictness: The leader must ensure that no one from within the teams disrupts the strategy. There is a delicate balance the leader must strike, displaying that they listen to constructive feedback while managing those who either through malicious intent or an inability to communicate their ideas constructively present a disruptive voice. This looks wise and courageous to the team.

The last of the five constant factors is **Method and discipline**; this describes the actions necessary to remove impediments to progress. In the technology industry we call these blockers. Blockers prevent an individual or a team carrying out their objectives. Sun Tzu described:

> the marshalling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure.

The marshalling of the army and its proper subdivisions describes an **organisational structure**. Badly designed organisational structures create blockers, well designed organisational structures remove blockers. There’s no perfect organisational structure; they must be optimised for the most important objectives. Strategies must either take these organisational structures into account or they must change them.

The graduations of rank among the officers is a **career framework** and ensures the appropriate capabilities and temperament are deployed to manage the teams and their work.

The maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army equates to **good product, delivery and engineering management discipline** that ensures teams have work they can do that contributes to the strategic objectives. This also includes appropriate access to systems. Teams must be able to monitor, build and deploy their products as they need to.

The control of military expenditure equates to a well scoped and managed **budget** to ensure the team has all the team members they need at the right seniority and skill and capability level and all the software and systems they need.

## Managing the five constant factors

A wide variety of tools and tactics are available to modern businesses that allow them to manage all of these prerequisite conditions.

>In his book The Art of War,  Baron De Jomini states that "*…strategy fixes the direction of movements, and that we depend upon tactics for their execution.*"

These tools and tactics will be presented in the reverse order to the way Sun Tzu presented them. Sun Tzu’s five constant factors build up to the most important one which is the morale of the people executing the strategy. No matter how well skilled, disciplined and well resourced teams are if they aren’t committed to their work they will never be successful.

### Method and Discipline

It’s not a coincidence that new technology leaders often start by changing the organisational structures of their departments and the career frameworks of the roles reporting to them. Either they are also students of Sun Tzu or they have reached the same conclusion that Sun Tzu reached. In order for people to be effective in their roles they need to know where they fit in the organisation and the levels of influence and control they are expected to display. People also need to know what success looks like for the organisation, their team and themselves personally and what support is available to help them.

### Organisational Structures

Organisational structures are always optimised for something and when designing them or working within them it’s important to know what they’re optimised for and what challenges that presents. Every system optimised for something intrinsically contains challenges for something else. For example an organisation structure optimised for rapid progress will often make cost accounting more difficult. Consider an organisation composed of autonomous cross-functional teams. Each team can form an idea into a product scope, build it, deliver it into production, test it on customers and maintain it as a product throughout its useful life and they can do this quickly, they can create a simple new product in a couple of months and know if it’s successful or not a few weeks later. For many product and technology organisations this sounds like a utopia. Consider this organisation from a financial accounting perspective. The cloud bill goes up and down by random amounts month on month, how do the finance team find out what the cause of that was and whether there’s a trend forming? How do they budget cloud costs next year? In modern businesses cloud costs are the second biggest line item in the budget after salaries and pensions so when businesses need to manage costs all eyes fall on the cloud costs. Now consider capitalisation of assets. If a new product can be created, deployed and considered a failure over a ten week period how could development time be capitalised against assets? The asset might not even be there when capitalisation is being considered. In both of these cases finance teams would be forced to form relationships with many teams, and work around many different schedules in order to get the information they need or initiate the changes that need to be made. Every organisation structure presents challenges. The trick to designing a good organisation structure is to choose what to optimise for and then mitigate the challenges.

While I was Director of Site Reliability Engineering at Just Eat we had very high performing teams. They weren’t entirely cross-functional but they could move fast and they could quickly scale services up and down and flex their infrastructure to cope with new services and partners as they came along. This frequently led to anomalies in the cloud costs. We solved this by having a Service Management team. They helped the finance teams understand the cloud bills and they helped the engineering teams reduce costs when that was required. It was a great mitigation against what, to finance, looked like chaos. It then led to emergent capabilities that helped us coordinate zero-day security fixes and implement more proactive cost management solutions. This is an example of what I meant by designing solutions to mitigate the weaknesses or challenges inherent in an organisational design. 

### Career Frameworks

Just as organisational structures help teams place themselves in the organisation and give their objectives some additional context so do career frameworks help individuals.

As described in Herzberg's Hygiebe Factors <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_theory> Employees relationships with their manager is the source of the most important motivating factors so it shouldn’t come as a surprise that the career framework is important as it provides a context for that relationship. The expectations a manager and the organisation has on an individual is defined by their capability and experience and those have a direct impact on their seniority which is defined in the career framework. The career framework is also where the organisation forms a contract with the individual. Consistently meet these criteria, it says, and you will do well, consistently fail to meet these criteria and you will be subject to disciplinary action. The career framework then is an ideal place for a leader to formally communicate their expectations to their people.

### Product, delivery and engineering management discipline

Sun Tzu was concerned with getting his people where they needed to be and that they should be well fed, fit and healthy so they could fight. Today’s leaders are concerned with making sure their teams can execute on their objectives as quickly as possible. Making sure a team has the right objectives and priorities falls to the product management discipline. Making sure a team can execute on them as rapidly as possible falls to the delivery management discipline. Making sure a team can execute on their objectives successfully falls to the engineering management discipline. These aren’t necessarily roles, although it’s great if they are roles, these are disciplines or functions. Nothing stops a delivery manager from championing good product management practices and it should be expected that a good engineering manager would do the same and champion good delivery management practices as well.

In certain teams and in certain contexts these can be full-time jobs and hence become roles for individuals. More usually with a two-pizza team the delivery management role functions well across two teams. A full-time product manager is essential in a team performing user research and discovering  new opportunities. In a team managing a mature product, in a stable environment the product manager role can often either be shared across a few teams. An engineering manager is essential in an environment in the midst of a transition between old and new systems or old and new ways of working but in a mature stable environment a technology lead might be sufficient for a team and an engineering manager can manage several teams.

There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to leading teams and there’s a danger of over-standardisation. When this happens there are numerous negative effects. Ambitious engineering managers placed in charge of teams in stable environments create problems for everyone else by challenging what they see as out-of-date status quo positions without the big picture understanding of where the status quo is already being challenged in the organisation. This creates noise that needs to be dealt with. If left too long, the team will inevitably spend time on work that isn’t desired. This can poison a whole team as the work isn’t then accepted into the corpus of the software. Ambitious product managers and delivery managers forced to run stable teams will eventually leave but good product managers and delivery managers are exceptional communicators and even without necessarily intending it their frustration can have a knock-on effect to those around them.

### The trouble with Troikas

Troikas are becoming increasingly popular at the moment. The idea is sound, unfortunately it rarely works in practice. A troika in this context would be a formal arrangement where a Product Manager, Delivery Manager and Engineering Manager lead  teams to build and manage a product.

In Dune, Frank Herbert writes that "*In politics, the tripod is the most unstable of all structures*".

The reason for this is that in any group of three it is easier to agree things between two people and then the third is under pressure to come into alignment. product managers and delivery managers are often more accomplished communicators than engineering managers and more used to working toward consensus and so almost invariably the engineering manager is a frustrated quiet partner. The alternative is almost worse. Engineering managers who are frustrated with always coming second place, in such discussions, work themselves up into a besieged mentality and then they won’t budge because they don’t have the tools to negotiate.

In particularly unhealthy environments the loudest voice wins every argument and there isn’t even an agreement with two people. This is also disastrous, it results in teams having objectives with no clearly defined business value or teams having clear vision but no path to deliver or they have great engineering principles but no product value to deliver and no way to consistently deliver anything.

If a product manager, delivery manager and an engineering manager can form a working relationship then it’s an unstoppable force but it can’t be forced into happening with an organisational structure or policy.

One of the reasons we were as successful as we were in Zoopla is because of just such a trio but it's telling that I, the engineer in the trio, had more than 10 years experience more than the other two. Had they been as experienced as me I suspect I wouldn’t have been able to keep up with them and perhaps we wouldn’t have been able to forge the great relationship that we had.

### Budgeting

The final element of method and discipline that Sun Tzu defined was the control of expenditure. His reasons for caring about this are different to ours but it’s no less important a point. First of all, the budget must be controlled at appropriate levels. That means it can’t just be controlled by the executive team. Budget accountability must be devolved to all levels of the organisation. An executive  team, asking a group of managers how much money they need once a year or once a quarter is not going to yield helpful results. Managers at that level aren’t operating with the right perspective to answer that question and if they are then they aren’t operating at the right level of detail to do their day jobs well. Instead there need to be flexible structures in place to allow teams to draw on budget as they need to. This needs management but that’s hardly a difficult challenge.

The next aspect of budget management is ensuring that teams can respond to changes with budget expenditure where they need to spend it. Too often control over certain assets is centralised and poorly managed so there isn’t adequate flexibility. This leads to teams spending unproductive months building solutions they could have purchased.

This is what life was like before cloud computing. We had to plan server expenditure three years in advance because that was the period hardware was depreciated over. That was a ridiculous task and I have several examples where AOL UK missed out on significant opportunities simply because hardware wasn’t available. Thankfully those days are long gone but there are other assets that are subject to just such controls.

It’s common practice for organisations to give the older, worse spec laptops to contractors. That practice is idiotic. Why pay someone 700 pounds a day for their expertise and flexibility and then hamstring them with a poor machine. This happens because laptop budgets are being managed centrally by a function that is only accountable for expenditure and not on the results being delivered. This is an example of inappropriate budget controls.

Similar examples happen with network engineering and security systems. The teams implementing these systems often have little or no engagement in the process of delivering business value and so it’s not their problem if the solutions they implement impact the ability for product teams to deliver value.

### Leadership tools

Before a strategy is defined and teams structured to deliver it the leader must be present and have understood the challenges facing them. The 30/60/90 day plan concept has been designed to help achieve this. The first 30 days are spent gathering information, Meeting the people in the organisation who understand all the challenges from outside threats to impediments within the organisation and those challenges  inherent in the nature of the business. The next 30 days are spent defining strategies based on this information. Ideally this is done in partnership with the leader’s direct reports. This is a great time to build morale amongst this group and establish expectations of behaviours that will be rewarded and coach disruptive behaviours. This activity not only achieves the primary goal of forming a strategy, it also gives early insight into who the leader can rely on in their organisation and who needs more support. This also gives the teams some insight into the personality and expectations of the new leader and establishes an initial impression of wisdom. The next 30 days are spent putting the prerequisites for the strategy in place. This will include some quick tactical wins that build morale with the teams. In a technology business this might be achieving some basic product goals but are more likely to be DevOps type objectives like Improving pipelines, establishing some automated test capability or clearing cloud access or budget blockers. These wins send two messages: one to the teams that the leader is in touch with the problems they are facing day-to-day and another to the leader’s peers and stakeholders that action is being taken and problems are being brought under control. These actions also establish an impression of sincerity, the leader really is here to help, they have said they’re here to help and now they are helping. The next virtue the leader needs to establish is benevolence. There are many ways to do this, it's sufficient at first, just to establish relationships with some key people. This doesn’t just mean the most effective, or the most senior people. The leader should also seek out the gossips and the popular people. The goal is not to be their friend, the leader must always maintain a distance from their people, but they should at least be a human being to them. The leader should also look for opportunities to display their courage. Hard decisions should be faced head on and if possible, in public. Courage and strictness go hand-in-hand in a good leader. Sometimes the opportunity to display courage is in facing a difficult employee and dealing with them. Although always remember: Praise in public, rebuke in private.

### Earth

The strategist must understand the environment in which the business operates and the environment created by the business. Businesses either aim to be leaders or followers. Each presents different challenges but each requires the ability to make decisions quickly and execute on those decisions. This is where understanding the external and internal environment is so valuable. Externally the strategist is looking at the market the business operates in and those businesses it’s dependent on and further out to where trends, opportunities and challenges might emerge. Having identified something that requires action the strategist needs to understand how their business gathers information, makes decisions and takes action.

Without a formal decision making framework that is regularly practised, organisations are disorganised when facing change. Symptoms will include multiple meetings about the same thing, a lack of clear decisions at the end of each meeting, public criticism of any decisions made with no alternatives presented. When decisions are made they are made and applied only to a small part of the business. This creates fear in the organisation that important considerations are slipping through the cracks of the business and this requires more meetings. A decision making framework is important because no strategist or leader can be everywhere at once and they need to rely on teams and departments being able to make decisions when the strategy is under threat.

Security and dangers also fall under **Earth**. There are a wide range of threats that face a business. These include regulatory and compliance issues, physical and cyber security threats, environmental threats like severe weather and more recently global health threats that have significantly changed the environment inside and outside businesses.

The strategist needs to determine the range of threats that they need to take into account with each strategy. While all threats are always present and extreme impacts can always impact any strategy, the balance of probabilities needs to be accounted for. Severe weather might impact equipment delivery for a short while but it doesn’t need to fundamentally change a bring-your-own-device strategy.

Compartmentalisation is an essential tool of the strategist. As with all things it needs to be used in moderation, too much and there won’t be any strategies there will just be tactics. Too little compartmentalisation will also result in no strategies because it’s impossible to mitigate the most extreme impacts of risks. This philosophy of moderation is useful when dealing with threats. Consider security, the most secure system is one that has no connections to any other systems and allows no physical access. Not only is it very secure it’s also useless. Many organisations have technology and security policies designed by people who have no accountability for achieving business results. This often results in computer systems that are so hard to use it’s difficult to achieve anything with them. This is a very secure system, the business is unlikely to be troubled by security threats or any significant business success.

### Threat modelling

Threat Modelling can be applied to any system and it provides an opportunity to inspect a system from the perspective of a variety of different threats. Threat modelling is usually championed by security people but it can work for any type of threat.

I’ve used threat modelling for identifying security risks and designing mitigations for them but the process usually highlights other threats too. A couple of years ago Google changed how they rank sites, introducing Core Web Vitals as an important consideration for Search Engine Optimisation (SEO).  Discussion in a threat modelling workshop of a new application we were building highlighted Core Web Vitals as a threat. Until that point we had known about it and were testing regularly using development tools in our browsers but this conversation made us think about the problem as another threat that needed to be monitored. This led us to build some monitoring and alerts around those Core Web Vitals. This gave our leadership confidence that we wouldn't accidentally ruin SEO performance during day-to-day operation.

Threat modelling can start with assessing security threats but naturally leads a team to consider all manner of potential threats which can then be tackled each in turn. This is one of the ways public cloud was introduced in the British Government. It was very difficult to do anything on the low-spec, locked down machines and servers government IT provided. Teams demonstrated that a lot of government work could be done in the public cloud on their own laptops. These teams then tackled more and more complex problems, gradually finding modern solutions to the security problems that caused IT to lock everything down until only a very small number of use-cases still required the locked down machines and on-premise hosting solutions.

### Heaven

Businesses whose success is dependent on certain calendar events like valentines day for gifts businesses and black friday for ecommerce businesses are naturally very focused on these dates. It’s not uncommon to find change freezes and moratoriums planned weeks in advance of the key dates. One thing often missed by these businesses is identifying when it would be appropriate to be less risk averse; they rarely plan the rest of the year outside of those key dates.

This is something AOL did very well in the mid-late 90’s and early 2000’s. The AOL year revolved around Christmas. This always surprises people but in the late ‘90s-early and 2000’s a computer was a popular Christmas present and a lot of these computers came with AOL software installed. In the rare cases where it wasn’t we made sure every household had at least one AOL CD. This meant Christmas day was AOL’s busiest day. We did all the usual things that every business does to protect service on that day. What we did that, I later learned, was unusual was that we planned the rest of the year around Christmas. In practice this meant that the months immediately after Christmas were spent planning the year ahead. This meant assessing potential business opportunities against hosting and development costs. By spring development of new products was underway and I was waiting for new servers to arrive. Summer was spent developing and building infrastructure but with reduced staff levels as people took summer holidays. Autumn was the most intense time of year as teams rushed to finish products and get them launched because if they weren’t completed by the beginning of October there wouldn’t be time for them to get on to the new CDs and have supporting literature and marketing material printed and distributed. The US staff then disappeared for 4-5 days for thanksgiving. Finally came the pre-Christmas TV and magazine campaigns and then we battened down the hatches for Christmas. This was an incredibly effective strategy as can be seen by the success of AOL over those years.

Awareness of the seasonality of a business enables all kinds of low level tactics to be leveraged for success. In AOL the Green Light committee, where AOL’s senior leadership would choose where to allocate funding, could be scheduled months in advance, meaning there were never any concerns about availability.

Time zones are another temporal concern that provides challenges and opportunities for the strategist. If a business operates in just one timezone there is an entire night time when services can be maintained, experiments run, new services launched and smoke tested in production. This is usually difficult because most organisations don’t put policies and processes in place to support this kind of out of hours work. This is an enormous missed opportunity. There are other ways to solve these problems that don’t require out-of-hours work but they are all expensive and time-consuming to implement. That isn’t an argument against implementing feature-flagging, rolling deployments and blue-green deployment capabilities that support testing in production but if the organisation is small or not yet well funded then a little out-of-hours work in return for a day-off in lieu presents incredible value for money. Even businesses that operate in multiple time zones can do this; it just decreases how much time is available at night. Even global businesses have this opportunity, the Pacific Ocean is vast, there are about 3-4 hours when any change made will only affect 0.03% of the population.

Between 2009-2012 I worked at Electronic Arts, specifically at the Playfish studio where we used to make social games on Facebook. We took full advantage of timezones. There is a correlation between time zones and the lifetime value of a social gaming customer. A customer in the far east would spend about half as much as a customer in western Europe who in turn would spend about half as much as a customer on the west coast of the USA over their life playing our games. Customers in the Philippines were avid social gamers and would play for hours a day. This presented us with a wonderful opportunity. If we rolled out the updates to our games at just the right time we would catch players in the Philippines who would engage with the new content and would encounter any bugs or poorly optimised features first. We then had 6-7 hours to fix what was wrong before players in Europe would wake up and experience those changes. If things were really bad we had another 5 hours before the east coast US would see those changes and another 3 hours before we risked exposing the most valuable players to any problems. If things were that bad we could always roll back before those customers were affected and they would never know about any of the problems.

### The moral law

Everything discussed up to now builds to this point. All the other four constant factors act as demotivating factors for the people in our organisations. Not accounting for seasonal factors and how the work fits into the working day means constant disruption which makes people unsettled and they can’t perform their best. Not accounting for logistics, organisation of the physical working environment and threats that face the organisation mean our teams have to spend their time thinking about and dealing with these problems rather than building value generating products. Making our people work within organisational structures not optimised for the work we’re asking them to do creates a tense and hostile working environment that doesn’t encourage people to give their best. Finally, not giving people good and clear leadership that they can look up to means we’ll never get the best out of them. All these factors then chip away at morale.

## Conclusion

The strategist needs to have all the conditions (or as Sun Tzu called them, constant factors) right if they are to stand a chance of having teams execute their strategies successfully. With even one not right the chances of successful execution diminish. The more conditions are wrong the lower the chances of success.

The strategist must have all the management and leadership tools ever developed if they are going to be successful in the most challenging environments. Ideally the strategist won't have to know everything on their own they will be able to rely on capable leaders around them but a lot of organisations are struggling because of difficulties in this area.
