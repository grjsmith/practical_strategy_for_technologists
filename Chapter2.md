# Chapter 2: Prerequisites for executing a strategy

The new definition of a strategy, proposed in chapter one mentions conditions:

An identifiable pattern of actions that when performed in similar **conditions** will achieve the same results each time.

This chapter will examine those conditions.

## Sun Tzu’s Art of War

Sun Tzu's wrote the Art of War roughly 2,500 years ago. In the first chapter Sun Tzu provides a structure for thinking about the conditions the strategist has to contend with.

> The art of war, then, is governed by five constant factors, to be taken into account in one's deliberations, when seeking to determine the conditions obtaining in the field. These are: The Moral Law; Heaven; Earth; The Commander; Method and discipline.
>
> The moral law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler, so that they will follow him regardless of their lives, undismayed by any danger.
>
> Heaven signifies night and day, cold and heat, times and seasons.
>
> Earth comprises distances, great and small; danger and security; open ground and narrow passes; the chances of life and death.
>
> The Commander stands for the virtues of wisdom, sincerity, benevolence, courage and strictness.
>
> By Method and discipline  are to be understood the marshalling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure.

Sun Tzu's five constant factors provides a useful way for thinking about the conditions that will impact a strategy.

The moral law refers to the morale of the people in our teams. The strategist will rely on the teams to complete a variety of tactical objectives before the strategy is successful. To carry out a strategy the people must believe that they're doing the right thing for the right reasons. The people who make up product and technology departments are intelligent. Intelligent people need to understand the wider context they are working in.

When people, in product and technology organisations, ask their leaders about strategy they’re sending a message. They're telling their leaders that they want to deliver something significant. They want to be part of something greater than their teams. They have understood that the company is looking to achieve some worthwhile outcome. They know strengths and weaknesses and are looking for a shared purpose to unite them.

Heaven signifies the temporal conditions affecting teams. Seasonality is a major factor in some businesses. Businesses that sell gifts are dependent on Valentines day, Mothers day, Christmas and other significant holidays. E-commerce businesses depend on black Friday and Christmas. Some European businesses shut down during the summer. All businesses operate in one or more timezones. Global businesses only get a few quiet hours a day. Businesses operating in a single or a few time zones don’t need the same kind of resiliency. They can work on their systems during their quiet periods. Many businesses have staff in different timezones. These businesses need to organise collaboration during their Goldilocks hours. Failing that these businesses might need to manage their work asynchronously. These are all conditions that the strategist needs to take into consideration.

Earth represents the physical conditions. The most obvious ones being the ones Sun Tzu mentioned himself: distances, open ground, narrow passes. Logistics businesses invest a great deal in technology to optimise deliveries. Earth also includes dangers and security. Security must be prioritised appropriately. This means it mustn't be over-prioritised or under-prioritised. Over-prioritising security impacts time-to-market. The dangers of not prioritising security include everything from fines to existential threats.

The strategist needs a compelling leader for the teams to rally to. This is Sun Tzu’s commander. The attributes that Sun Tzu calls out are still important today. The leader needs to stand for these attributes, not literally embody them. The leader is the avatar of the strategy. The leader must appear wise, sincere, benevolent, courageous and in control. This way the teams will trust that they are being led well.

- Wisdom: Our people are intelligent but their perspective tend to be short-term. They must feel they are led by someone with a broad vision and a long-term view. This is how wisdom appears from the outside.

- Sincerity: A leader who appears sincere creates a safe environment. This encourages courage and innovation in the teams. This leads to opportunities that accelerate the strategy. Nothing undermines confidence  in leadership faster than when their actions don’t match their words.

- Benevolence: When people don't feel valued the most mobile will leave. Those who feel less able to find another job will play safe and try to stay beneath notice. These behaviours will not lead to the successful execution of a strategy. The best that can be achieved by people in this state is the maintenance of the status quo.

- Courage: The teams must feel they are being led with purpose. They must not feel their work is being directed by a committee. This will make them will lose confidence in their leadership. They must see their leader making commitments and holding themselves accountable just as they are being asked to do.

- Strictness: The leader must ensure that no one from within the teams disrupts the strategy. There is a delicate balance the leader must strike. They must show that they listen to constructive feedback. They must also show that they are managing those who are unable to communicate their ideas constructively.

The last of the five constant factors is Method and discipline. Method and discipline describes the actions necessary to remove impediments to progress. In the technology industry we call these blockers. Blockers prevent an individual or a team carrying out their objectives. Sun Tzu described:

> the marshalling of the army in its proper subdivisions, the graduations of rank among the officers, the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army, and the control of military expenditure.

The "marshalling of the army and its proper subdivisions" describes an organisational structure. Badly designed organisational structures create blockers, well designed organisational structures remove blockers. There’s no perfect organisational structure for every situation. Organisational structures must be optimised for the most important objectives.

The "graduations of rank among the officers" is a career framework. A good career framework ensures teams are staffed appropriately.

'The maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army" equates to good product, delivery and engineering discipline. This ensures teams have work they can do that contributes to the strategic objectives. This also includes appropriate access to systems. Teams must be able to monitor, build and deploy their products as they need to.

"The control of military expenditure" equates to a well scoped and managed budget. This ensures the team has all the team members they need. It ensures the team has the right knowledge, skills and capabilities. It also ensure the teams have all the software and systems they need to build the product.

### Managing the five constant factors

A wide variety of tools and tactics are available to modern businesses that allow them to manage all of these conditions.

In his book The Art of War, Baron De Jomini states that:

>"…strategy fixes the direction of movements, and that we depend upon tactics for their execution."

Sun Tzu’s five constant factors build up to the most important one which is the morale of the people executing the strategy. If teams aren't committed to the strategy they will never be successful. As such the tools and tactics for managing the condition will be presented in the reverse order to the way Sun Tzu presented them.

#### Method and Discipline

In order for people to be effective in their roles they need to know where they fit in the organisation. This is why it's common for new technology leaders to change the organisational structure of their departments. Either they are also students of Sun Tzu or they have reached the same conclusion that Sun Tzu reached.

##### Organisational Structures

When optimising a system to make some tasks easier other tasks become more difficult. This is as true for organisational structures as for any other system. An organisational structure designed for rapid progress will often make cost management more difficult. Consider an organisation composed of autonomous cross-functional teams. All the teams can build the solutions they need. Their independence from each other means they can do this quickly. They can create a simple new product in a couple of months and know if it’s successful or not a few weeks later. For many product and technology organisations this sounds like a utopia. Consider this organisation from a financial accounting perspective. The cloud bill goes up and down by random amounts month on month as new services are built and others are decommissioned. The finance team would need to investigate every change to find out the cause. They would need to do this to determine if a trend was forming. Forecasting would be impossible. In modern businesses cloud costs are the second biggest line item in the budget after salaries and pensions. When businesses need to manage costs all eyes fall on the cloud costs. If a new product can be created, deployed and considered a failure over a ten week period it would be very difficult to capitalise the development costs? The asset might not even be there when capitalisation is being considered. In both of these cases the finance team would need to form relationships with all the teams. They would need to work around all the different schedules in order to get the information they need. Every organisation structure presents challenges. When designing an organisation structure difficult choices need to be made. The choice about what to optimise for is the easy one. The choice of what problems to accept is the hardest one. The strategist should choose the problems that the organisation is best able to deal with.

Just Eat had very high performing autonomous teams. They could move fast and they could quickly scale their services up and down. They could flex their services to cope when new capabilities and partners came along. This frequently led to anomalies in the cloud costs. We solved this by having a Service Management team. They helped the finance teams understand the cloud bills. They helped the engineering teams reduce costs when the business needed cost reductions. It was a great mitigation against what, to finance, looked like chaos. It then led to emergent capabilities that helped us coordinate zero-day security fixes. They also implemented more proactive cost control solutions. This is an example of designing solutions to mitigate the weaknesses inherent in an organisational structure.

##### Career Frameworks

Organisational structures help teams understand their role in the organisation. Career frameworks do the same thing for employees.

Herzberg's Two-factor theory shows that an employees relationship with their manager is the source of the most important motivating factors. This is just one reason why career frameworks are important they provide a context for employee/manager relationship. The expectations a manager and the organisation has of an employee is defined by their capability and experience and those have a direct impact on their seniority which is defined in the career framework. The career framework is also a contract between the employee and the organisation. Consistently meet these criteria, it says, and you will do well. Fail to meet these criteria and you will be subject to disciplinary action. The career framework then is an ideal place for a leader to formally communicate their expectations to their people.

##### Product, delivery and engineering management discipline

Sun Tzu was concerned with getting his people where they needed to be. He needed them to be well fed, fit, and healthy so they could fight. Today business leaders are concerned with making sure their teams can execute on their objectives as quickly as possible. Making sure a team has the right objectives and priorities falls to the product management discipline. Making sure a team can execute on them as rapidly as possible falls to the delivery management discipline. Ensuring a team can execute on their objectives with quality falls to the engineering discipline. These aren’t necessarily roles; they are disciplines or functions.

In certain teams and in certain contexts these can be full-time jobs. More usually a delivery management role functions well across two teams. A full-time product manager is essential in a team performing user research and discovering  new opportunities. In a team managing a mature product, in a stable environment the product manager role can often work across a few teams. An engineering manager is essential in an environment in the midst of a transition, or when building something new. In a mature, stable environment a lead or staff engineer might work as well.

There’s no one-size-fits-all approach to leading teams. There is a danger of over-standardisation. When this happens there are various negative effects. Ambitious engineering managers placed in charge of teams in stable environments create problems. They will challenge, what they see, as out-of-date positions without understanding the bigger picture. This creates noise that needs to be dealt with. If left too long, the team will spend time on work that isn’t needed. When their work isn’t accepted it will cause bitterness. Ambitious product managers and delivery managers forced to run stable products will eventually leave in frustration.

Mandating Troikas popular at the moment. The idea is sound, unfortunately it rarely works in practice. A troika, in this context, is where a Product Manager, Delivery Manager and Engineering Manager work together to lead a team or a product.

In Dune, Frank Herbert writes that "*In politics, the tripod is the most unstable of all structures*".

The reason for this is that in any group of three it is easier to agree things between two and then the third is under pressure to come into alignment. Product managers and delivery managers are often better communicators than engineering managers. They are also more used to working toward consensus. This usually results in the engineering manager becoming a frustrated quiet partner. The alternative is almost worse. Frustrated engineering managers can work themselves up into a seige mentality. They become intransigent because they don’t have the tools to negotiate.

In particularly unhealthy environments the loudest voice wins every argument. Then there isn’t even an agreement between two people. This is also disastrous. This can lead to teams having objectives with no defined business value. Teams might have a clear vision but no way to deliver. The team might have great engineering principles but no product value to deliver and no way to deliver anything.

If a product manager, delivery manager and an engineering manager can form a working relationship then it’s an unstoppable force. That relationship can’t be forced into happening with an organisational structure or a policy.

One of the reasons I was successful in Zoopla is because of such a trio. It's telling that I, the engineer in the trio, had much more experience more than the other two. Had we been at the same points in our careers then I suspect I wouldn’t have been able to keep up with them. Perhaps then we wouldn’t have been able to forge the great relationship that we had.

##### Budgeting

The final element of method and discipline was the control of expenditure. First of all, the budget must be controlled at appropriate levels. That means it can’t just be controlled by the executive team. Budget accountability must be devolved to all levels of the organisation. An executive  team, asking a group of managers how much money they need once a year or once a quarter is not going to yield useful results. Managers at that level aren’t operating with the right perspective to answer that question. If they are then they aren’t operating at the right level of detail to do their day jobs well. Instead there need to be flexible structures in place to allow teams to draw on budgets that are managed by their directors.

Teams also need the ability to respond to problems with budget expenditure rather than just engineering effort. With centralised budget control there often isn’t adequate flexibility. This leads to teams spending unproductive time building solutions they could have purchased.

It’s a common practice for organisations to give the older, worse spec laptops to contractors. That practice is idiotic. The organisation is paying upwards of 600 pounds a day for contractor expertise and flexibility. Then another department hamstrings them with an old machine. This happens because laptop budgets are being managed by a function that is only accountable for expenditure with no accountability for business outcomes. This is an example of inappropriate budget controls.

Similar examples happen with network engineering and security systems. The teams implementing these systems often have little or no engagement in the process of delivering business value. It’s not their problem if the solutions they implement impact the ability for product teams to deliver value.

Appropriate budget controls need to be available to the people accountable for achieving business outcomes.

#### Earth

The next of the Five Constant Factors to consider is Earth. The strategist must understand the environment in which the business operates and the environment created by the business. Businesses need the ability to make decisions quickly and execute on those decisions. This is where understanding the external and internal environment is so valuable. Externally the strategist is looking at the market the business operates in and those businesses it’s dependent on and further out to where trends, opportunities and challenges might emerge. Having identified something that requires action the strategist needs to understand how their business gathers information, makes decisions and takes action.

Without a formal decision making framework that is regularly practised, organisations are disorganised when facing change. Symptoms will include multiple meetings about the same thing, a lack of clear decisions at the end of each meeting, public criticism of any decisions made with no alternatives presented. When decisions are eventually made they are made and applied only to a small part of the business. This creates fear in the organisation that important considerations are slipping through the cracks and this requires more meetings with more people. A decision making framework is important because no strategist or leader can be everywhere at once and they need to rely on teams and departments being able to make decisions when the strategy is under threat.

Security and dangers also fall under the Earth constant factor. There are a wide range of threats that face a business. These include regulatory and compliance issues, physical and cyber security threats, environmental threats like severe weather and more recently global health threats that have significantly changed the environment inside and outside our organisations.

The strategist needs to determine the range of threats that they need to take into account with each strategy. While all threats are always present and extreme impacts can always impact any strategy, the balance of probabilities needs to be accounted for.

Compartmentalisation is an essential tool of the strategist. As with all things it needs to be used in moderation, too much and there won’t be any strategies there will just be tactics. Too little compartmentalisation will also result in no strategies because it’s impossible to mitigate the most extreme impacts of risks. This philosophy of moderation is useful when dealing with threats. Consider security, the most secure system is one that has no connections to any other systems and allows no physical access. Not only is it very secure it’s also almost useless. Many organisations have technology and security policies designed by people who have no accountability for achieving business outcomes. This often results in computer systems that are so hard to use it’s difficult to achieve anything with them. This is a very secure system, the business is unlikely to be troubled by security threats or any significant business success.

##### Threat modelling

Threat Modelling can be applied to any system and it provides an opportunity to inspect a system from the perspective of a variety of different threats. Threat modelling is usually championed by security people but it can work for any type of threat.

I’ve used threat modelling for identifying security risks and designing mitigations for them but the process usually highlights other threats too. A few years ago Google changed how they rank sites in their Search algorithm. They introduced the Core Web Vitals as an important consideration for Search Engine Optimisation (SEO). Discussion in a threat modelling workshop of a new application we were building highlighted Core Web Vitals as a threat. Until that point we had known about it and were testing regularly using development tools in our browsers but this conversation made us think about the problem as another threat that needed to be monitored. This led us to build some monitoring and alerts around those Core Web Vitals. This gave our leadership confidence that we wouldn't accidentally ruin SEO performance during day-to-day operation.

Threat modelling can start with assessing security threats but naturally leads a team to consider all manner of potential threats which can then be managed. This is one of the ways public cloud was introduced in the British Government. It was very difficult to do anything on the low-spec, locked down machines and servers government IT provided. We demonstrated that a lot of government work could be done in the public cloud on our own personal laptops. We worked together with project teams to solve more complex problems. Gradually we found modern solutions to the security problems that caused IT to lock everything down. until finally only a very small number of use-cases still required the locked down machines and on-premise hosting solutions.

#### Heaven

There are Businesses whose success is dependent on certain calendar events like valentines day for gifts businesses and black friday for e-commerce businesses. They are, naturally, very focused on these dates. It’s not uncommon to find change freezes and moratoriums planned weeks in advance of the key dates. One thing often missed by these businesses is identifying when it would be appropriate to be less risk averse; they rarely plan the rest of the year outside of those key dates.

This is something AOL did very well in the early 2000’s. The AOL year revolved around Christmas. This always surprises people but in the late ‘90s-early and 2000’s a computer was a popular Christmas present and a lot of these computers came with AOL software installed. In the rare cases where it wasn’t we made sure every household had at least one AOL CD. This meant Christmas day was AOL’s busiest day. We did all the usual things that every business does to protect service on that day. What was unusual was that we planned the rest of the year around Christmas. In practice this meant that the months immediately after Christmas were spent planning the year ahead. This meant assessing potential business opportunities against hosting and development costs. By spring development of new products was underway and I was waiting for new servers to arrive. Summer was spent developing and building infrastructure but with reduced staff levels as people took summer holidays. Autumn was the most intense time of year as teams rushed to finish products and get them launched because if they weren’t completed by the beginning of October there wouldn’t be time for them to get on to the new CDs and have supporting literature and marketing material printed and distributed. The US staff then disappeared for 4-5 days for thanksgiving. Finally came the pre-Christmas TV and magazine campaigns and then we battened down the hatches for Christmas. This was an incredibly effective strategy as can be seen by the success of AOL over those years.

Awareness of the seasonality of a business enables all kinds of low level tactics to be leveraged for success. In AOL the Green Light committee, where AOL’s senior leadership would choose where to allocate funding, could be scheduled months in advance, meaning there were never any concerns about people's availability.

Time zones are another temporal concern that provides challenges and opportunities for the strategist. If a business operates in just one timezone there is an entire night time when services can be maintained, experiments run, new services launched and smoke tested in production. This is usually difficult because most organisations don’t put policies and processes in place to support this kind of out of hours work. This is an enormous missed opportunity. There are other ways to solve these problems that don’t require out-of-hours work but they are all expensive and time-consuming to implement. That isn’t an argument against implementing feature-flagging, rolling deployments and blue-green deployment. If the organisation is small or not yet well funded then a little out-of-hours work in return for a day-off in lieu presents incredible value for money. Even businesses that operate in multiple time zones can do this; it just decreases how much time is available at night. Even global businesses have this opportunity, the Pacific Ocean is vast, there are about 3-4 hours when any change made will only affect 0.03% of the population.

While I worked at Electronic Arts we took full advantage of timezones. There is a correlation between time zones and the lifetime value of a gamer. A gamer in the far east would spend about half as much as one in western Europe who in turn would spend about half as much as a someone on the west coast of the US. Gamers in the Philippines were avid players and would play for hours a day. This presented us with a wonderful opportunity. If we rolled out the updates to our games at just the right time we would catch players in the Philippines who would engage with the new content and would encounter any bugs or poorly optimised features first. We then had 6-7 hours to fix what was wrong before players in Europe would wake up and experience those changes. If things were really bad we had another 5 hours before the east coast US would see those changes and another 3 hours before we risked exposing the most valuable players to any problems. If things were that bad we could always roll back before those customers were affected and they would never know about any of the problems.

#### The moral law

Everything discussed up to now builds to this point. All the other four constant factors act as demotivating factors for the people in our organisations. Not accounting for seasonal factors and how the work fits into the working day means constant disruption which makes people unsettled. Not accounting for logistics, the working environment and threats mean our teams have to work resolving incidents that could have been avoided. Making our people work within organisational structures not optimised for the work we’re asking them to do creates a toxic environment where it's easier to fail than to succeed. Not giving people good and clear leadership that they can look up to means we’ll never get the best out of them.

## Conclusion

The strategist needs to have all the conditions (or as Sun Tzu called them, constant factors) right if they are to stand a chance of having teams execute their strategy successfully. With even one systemic disfunction the chances of successful execution diminish.

This means that the first order of business for the strategist is to get the organisation to the point where it can successfully execute a strategy.
